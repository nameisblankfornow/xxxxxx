modulator || modulator || modulator activator
modulator || modulator || binds to and activates a receptor but is only able to elicit partial efficacy at that receptor or binds to a receptor at a site distinct from the active site and induces a conformational change in the receptor, which alters the affinity of the receptor for the endogenous ligand
