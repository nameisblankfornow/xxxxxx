Despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype-selective tool for physiologic experiments, its precise effect on GluN1/GluN2B gating is yet to be fully understood. Interestingly, recent crystallographic evidence identified that ifenprodil, unlike zinc, binds at the interface of the GluN1/GluN2B amino terminal domain dimer by an induced-fit mechanism. To delineate the effect of this unique binding on GluN1/GluN2B receptor gating, we recorded steady-state currents from cell-attached and outside-out patches. At pH 7.9 in cell-attached patches, ifenprodil increased the occupancy of the long-lived shut conformations, thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time. In addition, ifenprodil selectively affected the area of shut time constants, but not the time constants themselves. Kinetic analyses suggested that ifenprodil prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state. We found distinct differences in the action of ifenprodil at GluN1/GluN2B in comparison with previous studies on the effect of zinc on GluN1/GluN2A gating, which may arise due to their unique binding sites. Our data also uncover the potential pH-dependent action of ifenprodil on gating. At a low pH (pH 7.4), but not pH 7.9, ifenprodil reduces the mean open time of GluN1/GluN2B receptors, which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context-dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke, when the pH of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic.",

All mammalian isozymes of human (h) or murine (m) origin hCA I-hCA XII, mCA XIII and hCA XIV were inhibited in the low micromolar or submicromolar range by these (poly)phenols (K(I)s in the range of 0.87-7.79 microM). p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (K(I)s of 0.87-35.4 microM) and the different isozymes showed very variable inhibition profiles with these derivatives. Phenols like the ones investigated here possess a CA inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. Unlike the sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are anchored at the Zn(II)-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various amino acid residues. As this is the region with the highest variability between the many CA isozymes found in mammals, this class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant CAs.",

The expression of ASCT2 in WKY and SHR PTE cells and kidney cortices from WKY and SHR was also evaluated. l-[(14)C]alanine uptake was highly dependent on extracellular Na(+). Replacement of NaCl by LiCl or choline chloride abolished transport activity in SHR and WKY PTE cells. In the presence of the system L inhibitor BCH, Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake in WKY and SHR PTE cells was inhibited by alanine, serine, and cysteine, which is consistent with amino acid transport through ASCT2. The saturable component of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine transport under V(max) conditions in SHR PTE cells was one-half of that in WKY PTE cells, with similar K(m) values. Differences in magnitude of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake through ASCT2 between WKY and SHR PTE cells correlated positively with differences in ASCT2 protein expression, this being more abundant in WKY PTE cells. Abundance of ASCT2 transcript and protein in kidney cortices of SHR rats was also lower than that in normotensive WKY rats. In conclusion, immortalized SHR and WKY PTE cells take up l-alanine mainly through a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporter, with functional features of ASCT2 transport.

Our aim was to identify the signaling mechanisms stimulated by testosterone (TES) in microvascular arteries and to understand how these mechanisms mediate TES-induced vasodilation. Mesenteric microvessels were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tension studies demonstrated a rapid, concentration-dependent, vasodilatory response to TES that did not involve protein synthesis or aromatization to 17\u03b2-estradiol. Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and nitrotyrosine immunoblot experiments indicated that TES stimulated peroxynitrite formation in microvessels, and functional studies demonstrated that TES-induced vasodilation was inhibited by scavenging peroxynitrite. As predicted, TES enhanced the production of both peroxynitrite precursors (i.e., superoxide and nitic oxide), and xanthine oxidase was identified as the likely source of TES-stimulated superoxide production. Functional and biochemical studies indicated that TES signaling involved activity of the phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase-protein kinase B (Akt) cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor and culminated in enhanced production of cGMP and microvascular vasodilation. These findings, derived from a variety of analytical and functional approaches, provide evidence for a novel nongenomic signaling mechanism for androgen action in the microvasculature: TES-stimulated vasodilation mediated primarily by peroxynitrite formed from xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide and NO. This response was associated with activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt signaling cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor. We propose this mechanism could account for TES-stimulated cGMP production in microvessels and, ultimately, vasodilation.",

Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate insulin signaling through the protein kinase B (AKt) pathway and up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 \u03bcM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation.

Previous studies established that stimulation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells activates Rac1 and enhances motility via the Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1. As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that ErbB-driven Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the Jak2 pathway. Moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activity involves the alteration of the balance between Rho and Rac.",

A ChIP assay showed that SF-1 could bind to the FDX1 promoter in differentiated hMSCs.

Butein, a plant polyphenol, is one of the major active components of R. verniciflua. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced via dental adhesive bleaching agents and pulpal disease, can cause oxidative stress. Here, we found that butein possesses cytoprotective effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced dental cell death. H2O2 is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of butein, and these effects were dose dependent. Butein also increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and HO activity. In addition, butein-dependent HO-1 expression was required for the inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, butein treatment caused nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the promoter activity of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation.

In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the \"global affinity\" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.",

Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of ethidium homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells. Also, ursolic acid enhanced the cleavages of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase3, attenuated the expression of astrocyte elevated gene (AEG1) and survivin in HepG2 cells.

Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C or GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 blocked the cleavages of PARP and caspase 3 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells.

In the locus coeruleus, brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) on norepinephrine neuronal firing (ED50 = 110 mug/kg), demonstrating 5-HT2A antagonistic action. Brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the DA agonist apomorphine on VTA DA neurons (ED50 = 61 mug/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered alone, indicating partial agonistic action on D2 receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, which significantly inhibited the firing activity of VTA DA neurons, brexpiprazole displayed less efficacy at D2 receptors.

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast, dexamethasone, or both. The IL-5 protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of IL-5 and CysLTR1 mRNA was performed using lung tissues. RESULTS: Pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of IL-5 protein in the culture medium by 40%. The combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect. Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of IL-5 mRNA in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. CysLTR1 mRNA was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. Pranlukast-induced inhibition of IL-5 mRNA expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their CysLTR1 mRNA expression status.

The most prominently used of these molecules include saccharin, aspartame (Nutrasweet), acesulfame-K, and cyclamate. Despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular T2R bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-K. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, TRPV1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, TRPV1 activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using Ca(2+) imaging on TRPV1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate TRPV1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that TRPV1 receptors are activated by CuSO(4), ZnSO(4), and FeSO(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate TRPV1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.",

AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.",

DBS was measured by using the pH-stat method and by using CO2-sensitive electrodes. 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (50 microM; DMA), a concentration that selectively inhibits the NHE isoforms NHE1 and NHE2, but not NHE3, did not affect DBS. Nevertheless, 3 mM DMA, a higher concentration that inhibits NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3, significantly increased DBS. Moreover, S1611 and S3226, both specific inhibitors of NHE3 only, or perfusion with Na+-free solutions, dose dependently increased DBS, as measured by pH-stat and CO2-sensitive electrode, without affecting intracellular pH. Coperfusion with 0.1 microM indomethacin, 0.5 mM DIDS, or 1 mM methazolamide did not affect S3226-induced DBS. Nevertheless, coperfusion with 0.1 and 0.3 mM 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, which inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR), dose dependently inhibited S3226-induced DBS. In conclusion, only specific apical NHE3 inhibition increased DBS, whereas prostaglandin synthesis, Na+-HCO3- cotransporter activation, or intracellular HCO3- formation by carbonic anhydrase was not involved. Because NHE3 inhibition-increased DBS was inhibited by an anion channel inhibitor and because reciprocal CFTR regulation has been previously shown between NHE3 and apical membrane anion transporters, we speculate that NHE3 inhibition increased DBS by altering anion transporter function.",

In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the \"global affinity\" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.",

In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of Akt activity. These studies suggest that HER2-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition of HER family tyrosine kinase signaling and suggest novel strategies to treat these particularly aggressive tumors.",

The profile of a range of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned human alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1D adrenoceptors and against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors. Indoramin and SNAP 1069 showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1B adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1D subtype. Rec 15/2739, WB 4101, SL 89,0591, (+)- and (-)- tamsulosin showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1B subtype.

The following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > SL 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > Rec 15/2739 > RS 17053 = SNAP 1069. 4. (-)-Tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities. The affinity estimate for prazosin on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at alpha 1A adrenoceptors and RS 17053 was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pA2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pKi = 8.6) determined at cloned human alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 5. In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo \"pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. Rec 15/2739 was a more potent antagonist of phenylephrine-mediated increases in prostatic pressure (\"pA2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure (\"pA2' = 7.51). 6. Data in this study suggest that the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an alpha 1A adrenoceptor, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned alpha 1A, alpha 1B or alpha 1D adrenoceptors. In addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors, particularly over the alpha 1D subtype, appear to inhibit phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. VEGF release into the media was measured using ELISA. TGF-\u03b21 receptor (T\u03b2R1)/Smad3 as a potential pathway for CSE modulated VEGF release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of Smad3 and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of T\u03b2R1. CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release but also inhibited baseline VEGF production. Suppression of T\u03b2R1 by the pharmacological inhibitor (SB431542) markedly reduced VEGF release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by T\u03b2R1 siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited VEGF release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates Smad3-mediated VEGF release by lung fibroblasts. Nicotine does not account for the CSE stimulation of VEGF in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.",

Sequencing of a full length clone isolated from a rat striatal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1311 base pairs, encoding a 437-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions. Within these hydrophobic regions, this receptor was found to be 41-36% identical to the following serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptors: 5-HT2 > 5-HT1D > 5-HT1C > 5-HT1B > 5-HT1A > 5-HT1E. Northern blots revealed a approximately 4.2-kilobase transcript localized in various brain regions, with the following rank order of abundance: striatum >> olfactory tubercle > cerebral cortex > hippocampus. Expression of this clone in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of high affinity, saturable binding of (+)-[2-125I] iodolysergic acid diethylamide ([125I]LSD) with a Kd of 1.26 nM. Among endogenous biogenic amines, only 5-HT completely inhibited [125I]LSD binding (Ki = 150 nM). The inhibition of [125I]LSD binding by other serotonergic agonists and antagonists revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with that of any previously described serotonin receptor subtype. In addition, this receptor exhibits high affinity for a number of tricyclic antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, including clozapine, amoxipine, and amitriptyline. In HEK-293 cells stably transfected with this receptor, serotonin elicits a potent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, which is blocked by antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. The distinct structural and pharmacological properties of this receptor site indicate that it represents a completely novel subtype of serotonin receptor. Based on its affinity for tricyclic psychotropic drugs and its localization to limbic and cortical regions of the brain, it is likely that this receptor may play a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders that involve serotonergic systems.",

Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization.

There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action.

Mibefradil blocked Nav1.5 in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization.

We further probed the interaction of mibefradil with inactivated Nav1.5 channels. Neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. In addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (Nav1.5 ICM + MTSET) did not alter mibefradil block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state.

When selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mV, mibefradil (1 microM) produced 45% fractional block in Nav1.5 and greater block (88%) in an isoform (Nav1.4) that slow-inactivates more completely. Our results suggest that mibefradil blocks Na+ channels in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).",

Accordingly, PTN-/- and MK-/- mice show an increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced neurotoxic effects. In an effort to uncover new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects, we have now used a proteomic approach to study protein phosphorylation, in which we combined phosphoprotein enrichment, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, in order to identify the phosphoproteins regulated in the striatum of PTN-/-, MK-/- and wild type (WT) mice treated with amphetamine. We identified 13 differentially expressed phosphoproteins that are judged to be relevant in the neuroprotective roles of PTN and MK against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. It is very interesting to note that 4 of these phosphoproteins, annexin A7 (ANXA7), COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) and creatine kinase U-type (CKMT1), are known to be involved in Parkinson's disease, a result of significant importance since PTN and MK have been also demonstrated to limit Parkinson's disease (PD) progress and have been suggested to be among the important genetic factors possibly preventing the development of PD in methamphetamine abusers. The data identify phosphoproteins differentially regulated by amphetamine treatment and/or the presence of endogenous PTN/MK which may be relevant mediators of PTN/MK neuroprotective effects against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. The data support further studies to validate the phosphoproteins here identified as possible new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for vitamin B6 therapy by measuring the level of total vitamin B6 in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from Arizona, were studied. (This includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) METHODOLOGY: A microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total vitamin B6 (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Children with autism had a 75% higher level of total vitamin B6 than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.00002). Most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. The autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/mL, median of 60 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) pyridoxal kinase had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP) levels are unusually low in children with autism. Thus, it appears that the low conversion of pyridoxal and pyridoxine to PLP results in low levels of PLP, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. CONCLUSIONS: Total vitamin B6 is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired pyridoxal kinase for the conversion of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to PLP. This may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in some children and adults with autism.",

A significant decrease in HLA-DR expression was observed in the AP and fractionated procyanidin-treated cells in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA), but no effect on CD86 expression was observed. The uptake of OVA was not inhibited by AP treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligase, MARCH1, was up-regulated by AP treatment. It can therefore be presumed that AP suppresses HLA-DR expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the up-regulation of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 was found in the procyanidin trimers-treated cells in the presence of OVA.

In in vivo tests, kinsenoside (50 and 100mg/kg) efficiently lowered blood glucose and cholesterol levels and it enhanced the oxidation resistance of diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin. In the in vitro assay, kinsenoside (20 and 50\u03bcg/mL) markedly inhibited changes in various biochemical substances (nitric oxide (NO), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) damaged by high glucose (35mM) and restored vascular endothelial structure by balancing the matrix metalloproteinases-the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-TIMP) system. The vascular protective effects of kinsenoside were speculated to be attributed to oxidative stress inhibition and the reduction of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) mRNA expression levels in high glucose conditions. Moreover, histological examination, including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, masson trichrome (Masson) staining, and periodic Schiff-methenamine (PASM) staining, greatly supported the morphological and functional amelioration of diabetes-related changes in mice aortas after kinsenoside (20 and 50\u03bcg/mL) treatment.

LY541850 was claimed from human mGlu receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist. We have verified this pharmacological profile of LY541850 in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the temporo-ammonic path (TAP) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) were inhibited by LY541850 in mGlu3-/- mice (EC(50) 38 nM) and wild-type littermates (EC(50) 42 nM) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in mGlu2-/- mice. The group II agonist, DCG-IV, inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes. Co-application of DCG-IV and LY541850 in mGlu3-/- and wild-type littermates resulted in an additive effect, whereas in mGlu2-/- mice, LY541850 reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV. These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist actions of LY541850. A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus. Systemic administration of LY541850 to wild-type mice, reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both phencyclidine and amphetamine administration.

Flecainide (1-300 mM) caused tonic and use-dependent block (UDB) of I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with WT, DeltaKPQ I(Na) was more sensitive to flecainide, and flecainide preferentially inhibited late I(Na) (mean current between 20 and 23.5 ms after depolarization) compared with peak I(Na). The IC(50) value of peak and late I(Na) for WT was 127 +/- 6 and 44 +/- 2 microM (n = 20) and for DeltaKPQ was 80 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 2 microM (n = 31) respectively. UDB of peak I(Na) was greater and developed more slowly during pulse trains for DeltaKPQ than for WT.

Recovery from block was slower for DeltaKPQ than for WT. We conclude that DeltaKPQ interacts differently with flecainide than with WT, leading to increased block and slowed recovery, especially for late I(Na).

In addition, alpha-lactalbumin (LA) enhances this Glc-T activity more than 25 times. Comparison of the crystal structures of UDP-Gal- and UDP-Glc-bound beta4Gal-T1 reveals that the O4 hydroxyl group in both Gal and Glc moieties forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317. The orientation of the O4 hydroxyl of glucose causes a steric hindrance to the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low Glc-T activity. In this study, we show that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to lysine (R228K-Gal-T1) results in a 15-fold higher Glc-T activity, which is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the Gal-T activity of the wild type. The kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of Arg228 to lysine is on the k(cat) of Glc-T, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of LA; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the Gal-T reaction is reduced 30-fold. The crystal structure of R228K-Gal-T1 complexed with LA, UDP-Gal, and Mn(2+) determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that the Asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. This alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the O4 hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal, probably causing the dissociation of UDP-Gal and the reduced k(cat) of the Gal-T reaction.",

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into Group 1 (n=10): normal healthy animals serving as the negative control group; Group 2 (n=60): the AD-induced group. After AD induction, animals in the AD-induced group were divided randomly and equally into 6 subgroups. The first subgroup served as AD control; the second one, which served as positive control, was treated orally with the conventional therapy for AD (rivastigmine) at a dose of 0.3\u2009mg/kg body weight (b.w.) daily for 3 months.

The alpha class human GSTA4-4 enzyme (hGSTA4-4) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward 4-HNE conjugation. However, hGST4-4 expression is low in most human cells and there are other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes that detoxify 4-HNE. In the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of hGSTA4 mRNA on the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 4-HNE injury. HepG2 cells transfected with an hGSTA4 vector construct exhibited high steady-state hGSTA4 mRNA, high GST-4-HNE catalytic activities, but lower basal glutathione (GSH) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. Exposure to 4-HNE elicited an increase in GSH concentrations in the control and hGSTA4 cells, although the dose-response of GSH induction differed among the two cell types. Specifically, hGSTA4 cells had significantly higher GSH concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microM 4-HNE, but not at 20 microM 4-HNE, suggesting extensive GSH utilization at high concentrations of 4-HNE. The hGSTA4 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of 4-HNE, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to 4-HNE. However, the hGSTA4 cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher 4-HNE exposures associated with increased GSH utilization. As expected, the hGSTA4 cells showed resistance to 4-HNE stimulated lipid peroxidation at all 4-HNE doses. In summary, our data indicates that over-expression of hGSTA4 at levels conferring high GST-4-HNE conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to HepG2 cells and protects against 4-HNE oxidative injury. However, the loss of proliferative capacity of hGSTA4 cells challenged with levels of 4-HNE associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, and/or GSH-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against 4-HNE toxicity.",

However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.",

Several new immunosuppressive agents and formulations are undergoing clinical investigation and are discussed in this review.A modified release tacrolimus formulation (MR4) for once-daily administration is undergoing phase III trials. It has been developed to be administered de novo or for maintenance using the same therapeutic target tacrolimus trough concentrations as for the original formulation. Belatacept (LEA29Y), a second generation cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig), blocks the interaction between CD80/86 and CD28 costimulatory pathways. In phase II trials, belatacept was as effective as ciclosporin (cyclosporine) when administered in combination with basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids. Currently, belatacept is undergoing phase III trials including one study in recipients of organs from expanded criteria donors. Inhibitors of the Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK)-3 show some selectivity for cells of the lymphoid lineage and have been shown to be effective in late preclinical transplant models.

OATP2B1 is widely expressed in tissues including the small intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle and platelets. Recently, it has been shown that differential promoter usage in tissues results in expression of five OATP2B1 transcriptional start site variants which utilize distinct first exons but share common subsequent exons. These variants are expected to encode either a full length (OATP2B1-FL) or shortened protein lacking 22 N-terminus amino acids (OATP2B-Short). Little is known regarding the transport activity and regulation of OATP2B1 variants with N-terminus truncation. Here, using absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction we find the full length variant is the major form expressed in duodenum but the short variant predominates in liver. Using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the short OATP2B1 variant towards substrates estrone sulfate and rosuvastatin are similar to the well-characterized full length variant. Transcriptional activity screening of the liver enriched OATP2B1 variant promoter identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4\u03b1) as a novel transacting factor. With a combination of in silico screening, promoter mutation in cell-based reporter assays, siRNA knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a functional HNF4\u03b1 binding site close to the transcription start site (-17 to -4 bp).

In addition, individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved Ser685-Thr686-Ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants T686A and S687A and altered K(m) and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine in mutant S685A. We conclude that the catalytic residues are His473 and Asp477, while Ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state. Several conserved lysines, i.e. Lys455, Lys505, Lys560 and Lys561, were also mutated. Only mutants K455A and K560A showed decreases in activity of 50%. The model rationalizes the finding of nine natural mutations in patients with hereditary L-CPT I deficiencies.",

We have previously reported that TZDs reduce estrogen synthesis by inhibiting aromatase activity in human granulosa cells (HGC). Multiple clinical trials demonstrated that TZDs increase the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We studied mouse osteoblasts alone or in a co-culture with HGC to determine whether TZD inhibition of aromatase plays a role in their effects on bone metabolism. Mouse osteoblasts were cultured with and without HGC, and incubated in a medium with or without testosterone, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone. Cell growth, oleic acid uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteocalcin production were measured. TZDs inhibited estradiol production by up to 84% in HGC/mouse osteoblast co-cultures. TZDs induced mouse osteoblast death and increased oleic acid uptake. TZDs also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity (58-75%, p<0.046) and osteocalcin production (52-75%, p<0.031). For all the parameters, there were no significant differences between the osteoblast cultures alone and the HCG/osteoblast co-cultures.

To determine whether these responses were common to other amphetamines of abuse, effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the plasmalemmal DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) were assessed. Similar to effects of METH reported previously, multiple high-dose MDMA administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal DA uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple METH injections, 1) MDMA caused little or no decrease in binding of the DAT ligand WIN35428, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of DA prevented the MDMA-induced reduction in plasmalemmal DA transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by MDMA in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting DAT function, MDMA rapidly decreased vesicular DA transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of MDMA and previously reported METH on DAT and VMAT-2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.",

Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 \u03bcM tolbutamide and 20 \u03bcM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 \u03bcM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 \u03bcM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations \u22652 \u03bcM in INS-1 cells.

In addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of Ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the Ras/RAF pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits C-RAF kinase was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF (wild type and V600E mutant). It inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of sorafenib revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and Kit), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling). In phase I and phase II clinical trials, sorafenib showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization.

In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839.

To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity.

In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity.

To investigate the possibility that felbamate's favorable toxicity profile could be related to NMDA receptor subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of felbamate block of recombinant NMDA receptors composed of the NR1a subunit and various NR2 subunits. Felbamate produced a rapid, concentration-dependent block of currents evoked by 50 microM NMDA and 10 microM glycine in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the rat NR1a subunit, and either the NR2A, NR2B or NR2C subunits; the IC50 values for block were 2.6, 0.52 and 2.4 mM, respectively (holding potential, - 60 mV). The Hill coefficient values were < 1 and, in kinetic analyses, onset and recovery from block were well fit by double exponential functions, indicating binding to more than one blocking site on the NMDA receptor channel complex. The higher affinity of felbamate block of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit could be accounted for by more rapid association and slower dissociation from these sites.

While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells.

This undesirable long QT side effect has been a major reason for the withdrawal of medications from the pharmaceutical market. Understanding the molecular basis of hERG block is therefore essential to facilitate the design of safe drugs. Binding sites for hERG blockers have been mapped within the inner cavity of the channel and include aromatic residues in the S6 helix (Tyr-652, Phe-656) and residues in the pore helix (Thr-623, Ser-624, Val-625). We used mutagenesis of these residues, combined with an investigation of hERG block by close analogs of clofilium and ibutilide, to assess how specific alterations in drug structure affected potency and binding interactions. Although changing the basic nitrogen from quaternary to tertiary accelerated the onset of block, the IC(50) and kinetics for recovery from block were similar. In contrast, analogs with different para-substituents on the phenyl ring had significantly different potencies for wild-type hERG block. The highest potency was achieved with polar or electronegative para-substituents, whereas neutral para-substituents had potencies more than 100-fold lower. Results from mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggest that phenyl ring para-substituents influence drug interactions with Thr-623, Ser-624, and Tyr-652 and strongly affect binding affinity.

In vitro data show comparable affinity to dopamine D(2), D(1) and 5-HT(2A) receptors and recently, FLX showed to be not inferior to risperidone in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative symptomatology, which was implicated with flupentixol's interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors. OBJECTIVES: To assess in vivo receptor occupancy (RO) in patients clinically treated with FLX (n = 13, 5.7 +/- 1.4 mg/day) in comparison with risperidone (RIS, n = 11, 3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/day) and haloperidol (HAL, n = 11, 8.5 +/- 5.5 mg/day). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each patient underwent two PET scans with 3-N-[(11)C]methylspiperone (target: frontal 5-HT(2A)), [(11)C]SCH23390 (striatal D(1)) or [(11)C]raclopride (striatal D(2)).

RESULTS: D(2)-RO under FLX was between 50% and 70%, indicating an ED(50) of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. 5-HT(2A) and D(1)-RO was 20 +/- 10% and 20 +/- 5% (mean, SEM).

CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate a moderate 5-HT(2A) and D(1) occupancy under clinically relevant doses of flupentixol, albeit lower than expected from in vitro data and clearly below saturation. Therefore, if flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms is based on its interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors, it should be highly dependent on serum concentration and thus on dosage and metabolism. However, these data suggest that mechanisms other than D(1) or 5-HT(2A) antagonism may contribute to flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms.",

The objective of the current study was to determine whether a low-dose subchronic DEX treatment (100 \u03bcg/kg for 8 consecutive days) exerts long-term effects on apoptosis in the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by examining the expression of cell death-promoting molecules (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p53, procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Bax) and cell-survival molecules (AKT, Bcl-2). Our results revealed that body, thymus and adrenal weight as well corticosterone level in the serum and PFC were reduced a day following last DEX injection. In PFC, DEX caused activation of AKT, augmentation of pro-survival Bcl-2 protein and enhanced Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, as well Bcl-2 translocation to mitochondria. The unaltered profile in the protein expression of apoptotic molecules PARP, procaspase 3 and Bax was detected, while the p53 protein was decreased. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed decrease of p53 mRNA level and no significant difference in Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expressions in DEX-treated rats. Finally, the DNA fragmentation assay and Fluoro-Jade staining demonstrated no considerable changes in the apoptosis in rat PFC. Our findings support the concept that a low-dose DEX creates the hypocorticoid state in the brain and indicate that subchronic DEX treatment activates pro-survival signalling pathway but does not change apoptotic markers in rat PFC. This mechanism might be relevant for DEX-induced apoptosis resistance observed during and after chemotherapy of patients with brain tumours. \u00a9 2013 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.",

Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT1F receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of sumatriptan with those of a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist (LY 344864) on c-fos protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos expression was induced in urethane-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal capsaicin administration. Sumatriptan and LY 344864 decreased the number of capsaicin-induced c-fos-like immunoreactive cells within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effect of sumatriptan, but not of LY 344864, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist SDZ 21-009, which displays high affinity for rat 5-HT1B receptors. LY 344864 appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via 5-HT1F receptors, while sumatriptan acts via 5-HT1B receptors. The fact that activation of 5-HT1F receptors is sufficient to modulate the activity of the trigeminal system suggests that this receptor may be a target for antimigraine drugs with improved safety profile.",

The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.",

Both pharmacologic inhibitors target several tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Up to this point, the PDGFR has not been a primary therapeutic target for this class of agents. The work of Chen and colleagues shows that dasatinib is a particularly potent inhibitor of PDGFR and that the compound also targets Src kinase. The authors suggest that this combination of activities could be useful in the treatment of vascular obstructive diseases.

Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GPR54-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of kisspeptin stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GPR54 mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GPR54 signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma luteinising hormone (LH) levels and significantly increases plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of kisspeptin results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence kisspeptin has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans.

In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of LTD4 (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases accompanied with increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP).

In this review, we look at the chemistry and biological activity of the cyclopenta[c]phenanthrenes (CP[c]Ph) as potential chemicals of concern in the process of risk assessment. The first part of the review deals with the environmental occurrence and chemistry of CP-PAHs, focusing on available methods of CP[c]Ph chemical synthesis. The most interesting structural feature of the CP[c]Ph is the presence of a pseudo fjord-region constructed by the cyclopentane ring. This compound can be treated either as a structurally similar one to B[c]Ph, or as a phenanthrene skeleton with an electrodonating alkyl substituent in the bay-region of the molecule. The second thread, providing available data on the adverse effects of CP[c]Ph compounds on cells and tissues of living organisms, mainly fish, improves our understanding of these possible environmental hazards. The data show that CP[c]Ph is less potent at inducing CYP1A gene expression in rainbow trout than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a well-known Ah-receptor agonist. Interestingly, the CP[c]Ph dependent up-regulation of CYP1A mRNA is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes. CP[c]Ph has, comparably to B[a]P, a potential to repress expression of tumor suppressor p53, in the head kidney of rainbow trout. Furthermore, estrogen responsive genes in fish liver, ER\u03b1 and VTG, are not induced by CP[c]Ph, suggesting that the compound has no endocrine disrupting potential. However, some CP[c]Phs show mutagenic activity when investigated in the Ames test, and exhibit genotoxic properties in in vitro micronucleus assay. The above characteristics suggest that CP-PAHs are chemicals of concern for which potential pathways of exposure should be further identified.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of beta1AR activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) network activity. AR expression was first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies against beta1ARs, which were found to be exceptionally dense in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. CA3 network activity was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat brain slices. The selective betaAR agonist isoproterenol caused an enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the CA3 region. In the presence of alphaAR blockade, concentration-response curves for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine suggested that a beta1AR was involved in this response, and the rank order of potency was isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine. Finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(b)) of subtype-selective betaAR antagonists were functionally determined to characterize the AR subtype modulating hippocampal CA3 activity. The selective beta1AR antagonists atenolol and metoprolol blocked isoproterenol-induced enhancement, with apparent K(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively.

METHODS: Cyclooxygenase activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production following incubation of varying concentrations of NSAID with human recombinant COX-1 or COX-2 and arachidonic acid. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microL (+/-) ketorolac 0.4% (Acular LS) or bromfenac 0.09% (Xibrom) and the other eye with 50 microL buffered saline. In control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. All animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before LPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PGE(2) production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous PGE(2) levels in vivo, measured by ELISA immunoassay. RESULTS: Ketorolac was six times more active against COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.02 microM) than COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.12 microM) while bromfenac was approximately 32 times more active against COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.0066 microM) than COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.210 microM). In the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of FITC-dextran leakage and PGE(2) production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. There was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of FITC-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of bromfenac-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of ketorolac-treated rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Ketorolac is relatively COX-1 selective while bromfenac is potently selective for COX-2 over COX-1. In the animal model, both ketorolac 0.4% and bromfenac 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. Only bromfenac 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.",

We attempted to achieve pharmacologically-induced enhancement of the parasympathomimetic activity of GAL in the key areas of rat brain, using an interactive combination of the alkaloid with the transmembrane enhancer L-carnitine (CAR). METHODS: We investigated activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain areas (frontal cortex, basal ganglia, septum and hippocampus) and the hypophysis, and that of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in plasma and liver. RESULTS: Following administration of the highest of the GAL doses used (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg i.m.), AChE activity decreased mainly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypophysis. In the interaction of GAL and CAR, AChE inhibition was stronger but without any statistical significance. The peripheral inhibition of BuChE was found to be dose-dependent. Premedication by CAR led to a slight change in the values of the activities monitored. CONCLUSIONS: CAR in terms of positive modulation of GAL targeting to the central nervous system had no statistically significant effect.",

While 5-HT(4) agonists are used as prokinetic agents, the physiological role of 5-HT(4) receptors in the human gut is unknown. AIMS: Our aim was to characterise the role of 5-HT(4) receptors in regulating gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and stimulated conditions with a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist. METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist (SB-207266) on the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone (a 5-HT(4) mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. In part B, 52 healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg of SB-207266 for 10-12 days; gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy on days 7-9, and fasting and postprandial colonic motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on day 12. RESULTS: Part A: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of SB-207266 had significant and quantitatively similar effects, antagonising the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal transit. Part B: SB-207266 tended to delay colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)), but did not have dose related effects on transit, fasting or postprandial colonic motor activity, compliance, or sensation. CONCLUSION: 5-HT(4) receptors are involved in the regulation of cisapride stimulated orocaecal transit; SB 207266 tends to modulate colonic transit but not sensory functions or compliance in healthy human subjects.",

AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.",

Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.",

Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3H]idazoxan (IDX) binding vs. [125I]p-iodoclonidine (PIC) binding. Nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3H] IDX were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3H]IDX-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes).

Affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125I]PIC binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > IDX > amiloride). However, the minor component of [125I]PIC binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3H]IDX, was consistent with a subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > IDX >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2A adrenoceptor.

The alpha class human GSTA4-4 enzyme (hGSTA4-4) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward 4-HNE conjugation. However, hGST4-4 expression is low in most human cells and there are other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes that detoxify 4-HNE. In the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of hGSTA4 mRNA on the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 4-HNE injury. HepG2 cells transfected with an hGSTA4 vector construct exhibited high steady-state hGSTA4 mRNA, high GST-4-HNE catalytic activities, but lower basal glutathione (GSH) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. Exposure to 4-HNE elicited an increase in GSH concentrations in the control and hGSTA4 cells, although the dose-response of GSH induction differed among the two cell types. Specifically, hGSTA4 cells had significantly higher GSH concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microM 4-HNE, but not at 20 microM 4-HNE, suggesting extensive GSH utilization at high concentrations of 4-HNE. The hGSTA4 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of 4-HNE, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to 4-HNE. However, the hGSTA4 cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher 4-HNE exposures associated with increased GSH utilization. As expected, the hGSTA4 cells showed resistance to 4-HNE stimulated lipid peroxidation at all 4-HNE doses. In summary, our data indicates that over-expression of hGSTA4 at levels conferring high GST-4-HNE conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to HepG2 cells and protects against 4-HNE oxidative injury. However, the loss of proliferative capacity of hGSTA4 cells challenged with levels of 4-HNE associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, and/or GSH-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against 4-HNE toxicity.",

The mutation responsible for the analogue resistance and L-proline accumulation was a single nuclear dominant mutation. By introducing the mutant-derived genomic library into a non-L-proline-utilizing strain, the mutant was found to carry an allele of the wild-type PRO1 gene encoding gamma-glutamyl kinase, which resulted in a single amino acid replacement; Asp (GAC) at position 154 was replaced by Asn (AAC). Interestingly, the allele of PRO1 was shown to enhance the activities of gamma-glutamyl kinase and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, both of which catalyze the first two steps of L-proline synthesis from L-glutamate and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, yeast cells expressing the mutated gamma-glutamyl kinase were found to accumulate intracellular L-proline and showed a prominent increase in cell viability after freezing at -20 degrees C compared to the viability of cells harboring the wild-type PRO1 gene. These results suggest that the altered gamma-glutamyl kinase results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase activity, which leads to an increase in L-proline production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Auranofin, an Au(I) compound, is a well-known and long-used anti-rheumatic drug. However, the mechanism as to how auranofin relieves the symptom of rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully clarified. Our results demonstrated that auranofin suppressed TLR4-mediated activation of transcription factors, NF-kappaB and IRF3, and expression of COX-2, a pro-inflammatory enzyme. This suppression was well correlated with the inhibitory effect of auranofin on the homodimerization of TLR4 induced by an agonist. Furthermore, auranofin inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by MyD88-dependent downstream signaling components of TLR4, MyD88, IKKbeta, and p65. IRF3 activation induced by MyD88-independent signaling components, TRIF and TBK1, was also downregulated by auranofin.

When Mn and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by Mn alone suggesting that Mn may suppress DA uptake in the DAT containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of Mn resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. Mn was also shown to decrease DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux in DAT containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that Mn can promote trafficking of cell surface DAT into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. Mn-induced internalization of DAT may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.",

While there is considerable indirect evidence to implicate histamine in the pathogenesis of asthma, a critical evaluation of H1-receptor antagonism in this condition has, until recently, proved difficult, as many of the early H1-receptor antagonists possessed additional actions, such as anti-cholinergic, local anaesthetic, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonistic and anti-serotonin activity. In addition, H1-receptor antagonists have been shown to have effects on mast cell function. In low concentrations in vitro, antihistamines have been found to inhibit immunologically stimulated mast cell mediator release, with the IC50 in the nanomolar to micromolar range, while at higher concentrations they induce histamine release. The potency of these drugs in producing such effects is unrelated to their H1-receptor blocking activity. Furthermore the sedative effects of these therapeutic agents limit the tolerable administrable dose and thus the degree of H1-receptor blockade achievable within the airways. The recent development of H1-receptor antagonists devoid of clinical sedative effects has enabled the administration of doses of H1-antihistamines which achieve a greater degree of H1-receptor blockade within the airways, thus permitting a better appraisal of the role of histamine in this condition. Furthermore, the receptor specificity of many of these agents has been focused such that terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine are devoid of anticholinergic activity and exhibit little alpha-antagonistic or anti-serotonin activity of clinical relevance. However, of these agents both loratadine and cetirizine possess additional actions likely to be of relevance to asthma. Pretreatment with loratadine has been shown to reduce the recovery of both histamine and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in nasal lavage fluid following nasal allergen challenge, a finding interpreted as indicative of in vivo mast cell stabilization, and cetirizine has been shown in vivo at therapeutic doses to inhibit allergen-induced eosinophil chemotaxis. Thus while both these agents offer the potential of an oral therapy for asthma based on an H1-receptor antagonist, their additional actions do not make them ideally suited to the exploration of the role of histamine in asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The profile of a range of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned human alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1D adrenoceptors and against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors. Indoramin and SNAP 1069 showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1B adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1D subtype. Rec 15/2739, WB 4101, SL 89,0591, (+)- and (-)- tamsulosin showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1B subtype. RS 17053 showed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1A adrenoceptors (pKi 8.6) relative to alpha 1B (pKi = 7.3) and alpha 1D (pKi = 7.1) subtypes. 3. (+)-Tamsulosin, (-)-tamsulosin, SL 89,0591, Rec 15/2739, SNAP 1069 and RS 17053 appeared to act as competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta yielding pA2 affinity estimates which were similar to binding affinities at cloned human alpha 1D adrenoceptors. The following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > SL 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > Rec 15/2739 > RS 17053 = SNAP 1069. 4. (-)-Tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities. The affinity estimate for prazosin on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at alpha 1A adrenoceptors and RS 17053 was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pA2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pKi = 8.6) determined at cloned human alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 5. In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo \"pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. Rec 15/2739 was a more potent antagonist of phenylephrine-mediated increases in prostatic pressure (\"pA2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure (\"pA2' = 7.51). 6. Data in this study suggest that the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an alpha 1A adrenoceptor, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned alpha 1A, alpha 1B or alpha 1D adrenoceptors. In addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors, particularly over the alpha 1D subtype, appear to inhibit phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure.",

Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an EP1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, PGE1>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2. SC-51089 (10(-5) M), a selective EP1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor. The PGE1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) M). PGE1 and PGE2 also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that R-type Ca2+ channels are involved. The inhibitory effect of PGE1 or sulprostone was prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin [islet activating protein (IAP)] or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine blocked the action of PMA.

We administered cAMP (10 microM in the perfusate) to 12 different groups of perfused kidneys. AMP was measured in perfusate using ion trap mass spectrometry.

In the present study we have analyzed the effects of short-term arsenite exposure on vascular function and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelium-dependent relaxations, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-type, were studied in rabbit iliac artery and aortic rings using the G protein-coupled receptor agonist acetylcholine (ACh) and by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), which promotes store-operated Ca(2+) entry by inhibiting the endothelial SERCA pump. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the endothelium of rabbit aortic valve leaflets and endothelium-denuded RIA and aortic rings was assessed by imaging of dihydroethidium. In the iliac artery, exposure to 100\u03bcM arsenite for 30min potentiated EDHF-type relaxations evoked by both CPA and ACh. Potentiation was prevented by catalase, the catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese porphyrin and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. By contrast in aortic rings, that exhibited negligible EDHF-type responses, endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations evoked by CPA and ACh were unaffected by arsenite. Arsenite induced apocynin-sensitive increases in ROS production in the aortic valve endothelium, but not in the media and adventitia of the iliac artery and aorta. Our results suggest that arsenite can potentiate EDHF-type relaxations via a mechanism that is dependent on hydrogen peroxide, thus demonstrating that dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by NADPH oxidase can potentially offset loss of NO bioavailability under conditions of reduced eNOS activity. By contrast, selective increases in endothelial ROS production following exposure to arsenite failed to modify relaxations mediated by endogenous NO.",

Additionally, AIF levels in the cytosol decreased due to EGTA but not due to calpeptin. This was also accompanied by a significant decrease in apoptosis.

Prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. We examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and IL-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes.

In activated microglia, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed iNOS promoter activity, iNOS mRNA, and protein levels.

Enzymes and binding proteins involved in retinoid metabolism are highly conserved across species. We previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of all-trans-retinol. Specifically, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol is transiently oxidized to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid before being oxidized further by Cyp26 enzymes. Here, we report the identification of two putative RetSat homologues in zebrafish, one of which, zebrafish RetSat A (zRetSat A), also had retinol saturase activity, whereas zebrafish RetSat B (zRetSat B) was inactive under similar conditions.

Exogenous all-trans-retinol, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol led to the strong induction of the expression of the retinoic acid-metabolizing enzyme, Cyp26A1, arguing for an active signaling function of dihydroretinoid metabolites in zebrafish.

Subsequently, pinosylvin suppressed the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, one of downstream molecules of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including BMP4, ID2, survivin, cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin might be associated with the cell cycle arrest and downregulation of cell proliferation regulating signaling pathways in human colorectal cancer cells.",

One of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of O(2)-regulated genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Nitric oxide (NO) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. We investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on HIF-1-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only SNP inhibits HIF-1 activation in response to hypoxia. In contrast, NTG or ISDN does not affect HIF-1 activity. SNP inhibits the accumulation of HIF-1alpha, the regulatory subunit of HIF-1, and the transcriptional activation of HIF-1alpha via a mechanism that is not dependent on either NO or soluble guanylate cyclase.",

One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a PDE4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of PDE4 (rolipram; 0.1-10 microM) and PDE3 (cilostazol; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a PDE4 or PDE3 inhibitor (10 microM) with salbutamol (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, rolipram (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of rolipram (10 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE5 (zaprinast; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a PDE4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.",

Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 increased by 1.4-fold within 5 min, and remained elevated throughout a 30-min time course, in response to 2-deoxyglucose. Global rates of protein synthesis declined by 78% of control values. The decline in protein synthesis was associated with repression of mTORC1 signaling, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and eIF4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1). Phosphorylation of ER-stress marker eIF2\u03b1 was also increased but only at 30 min of 2-deoxyglucose exposure. 2-Deoxyglucose increased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on AMPK consensus sites but did not change the amount of TSC1 bound to TSC2. Activation of AMPK did not result in changes in the amount of raptor bound to mTOR. The inhibitory effects of AMPK activation on mTORC1 signaling were associated with a marked increase in Ser792 phosphorylation on raptor.

Previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 declines with age and that pharmacological activators of SIRT1 confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. To determine whether dysregulation of SIRT1 promotes NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of SIRT1 (nicotinamide, sirtinol, EX527) in aorta segments isolated from young Wistar rats. Inhibition of SIRT1 induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187. Endothelial dysfunction induced by SIRT1 inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of SIRT1 significantly increased vascular superoxide production, enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, and mRNA expression of its subunits p22(phox) and NOX4, which were prevented by resveratrol. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) activation mimicked the effects of resveratrol while PPAR\u03b1 inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator. SIRT1 co-precipitated with PPAR\u03b1 and nicotinamide increased the acetylation of the PPAR\u03b1 coactivator PGC-1\u03b1, which was suppressed by resveratrol. In conclusion, impaired activity of SIRT1 induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype. Moreover, a new mechanism for controlling endothelial function after SIRT1 activation involves a decreased PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation and the subsequent PPAR\u03b1 activation, resulting in both decreased NADPH oxidase-driven ROS production and NO inactivation.",

METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.",

Substantial human and animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon tumors and prevent new tumor formation. The mechanism by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems complex as sulindac can modulate several growth-related signaling pathways. Sulindac metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular cyclic GMP and subsequently activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG); (b) activate c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); (c) inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2); and (d) decrease beta-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if PKG, ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin are independent targets for sulindac in vitro. Pharmacologic activation of PKG with YC-1 increases JNK phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation or beta-catenin protein expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 induces apoptosis but fails to activate JNK phosphorylation or down-regulate beta-catenin protein expression. Cotreatment with U0126 and YC-1 synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of sulindac treatment on ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin. These results indicate that sulindac metabolites modulate ERK1/2 and PKG pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of sulindac is mediated by more than one pathway. Using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies.

Carcinogenic arylhydroxylamine metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, NADH-dependent, oxygen-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to aromatic amine carcinogens. The purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. On the basis of our findings with structurally similar arylhydroxylamine metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens was catalyzed by NADH cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). We found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only human b5R and cyt b5. Specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (HLM), with similar Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m) values) in both systems. The stoichiometry for b5R and cyt b5 that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native HLM ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or cyt b5 significantly inhibited N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP). Finally, titration of HLM into the purified b5R/cyt b5 system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. We conclude that b5R and cyt b5 are together solely capable of the reduction of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following 4-ABP or PhIP exposure.",

The early metabolism of mifepristone is characterized by rapid demethylation and hydroxylation. Similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for CDB-2914 (CDB: Contraceptive Development Branch of NICHD) and CDB-4124, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. We have examined the functional activities and potencies, in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (RBAs) for progesterone receptors (PR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) of the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914, CDB-4124, and mifepristone and of the 17alpha-hydroxy and aromatic A-ring derivatives of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124.

Antiglucocorticoid activity was determined by inhibition of dexamethasone-stimulated transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells. The mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 had less antiglucocorticoid activity (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-6)M) than monodemethylated mifepristone (IC(50) approximately 10(-8)M) or the other test compounds.

Numerous studies indicate that S100A4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization.

    "abstract": "Identification of aldo-keto reductases as NRF2-target marker genes in human cells.\nTranscription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.",

In liver, MAT2A expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K(m) of methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 (the MAT2A product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to S-adenosylmethionine inhibition. METHODS: Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced S-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine levels.",

However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.",

The enzyme exists in a cytosolic and in a mitochondrial form because of the presence of two different KATI mRNAs coding for a protein respectively with and without leader sequence targeting the protein into mitochondria. We have cloned from a phage library of rat kidney cDNA four new KATI cDNAs containing different 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). One of the transcripts (+14KATI cDNA) contains an alternative site of initiation of translation. The tissue distribution of the different transcripts was studied by RT-PCR. The study demonstrated that several KATI mRNAs are constitutively expressed in ubiquitous manner, while +14KATI mRNA is present only in kidney. The translational efficiency of the different transcripts was studied in vitro and enzymatic activities were measured in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells. Each KATI mRNA exhibits a different in vitro translational efficiency, which corresponds to different levels of KAT enzymatic activity in transfected cells. Both findings correlate with the predicted accessibility of the ribosomal binding sites of the different mRNAs. The structure of the rat KATI/GTK gene was also studied.

We aimed to address the hypothesis that platelets contribute to aberrant COX-2 expression in HT29 colon carcinoma cells and to reveal the role of platelet-induced COX-2 on the expression of proteins involved in malignancy and marker genes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT). Human platelets co-cultured with HT29 cells rapidly adhered to cancer cells and induced COX-2 mRNA expression, but not protein synthesis which required the late release of platelet PDGF and COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Platelet-induced COX-2-dependent PGE2 synthesis in HT29 cells was involved in downregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and upregulation of cyclinB1, since these effects were prevented by rofecoxib(a selective COX-2 inhibitor) and rescued by exogenous PGE2. Galectin-3, highly expressed in HT29 cells, is unique among galectins because it contains a collagen-like domain. Thus, we studied the role of galectin-3 and platelet collagen receptors in platelet-induced COX-2 overexpression. Inhibitors of galectin-3 function(\u03b2-lactose, a dominant-negative form of galectin-3,Gal-3C, and anti-galectin-3 antibody M3/38) or collagen receptor-mediated platelet adhesion(revacept, a dimeric collagen receptor GPVI-Fc) prevented aberrant COX-2 expression. Inhibition of platelet-cancer cell interaction by revacept was more effective than rofecoxib in preventing platelet-induced mRNA changes of EMT markers suggesting that direct cell-cell contact and aberrant COX-2 expression synergistically induced gene expression modifications associated with EMT. In conclusion, our findings provide the rationale for testing blockers of collagen binding sites, such as revacept, and galectin-3 inhibitors in the prevention of colon cancer metastasis in animal models followed by studies in patients.",

Meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central cyclooxygenase (COX)-3 have been rejected. The fact that acetaminophen acts functionally as a selective COX-2 inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential COX-2 blockade. Ex vivo COX inhibition and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. Coagulation-induced thromboxane B(2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E(2) were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. In vitro, acetaminophen elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward COX-2 inhibition (IC(50)=113.7 micromol/L for COX-1; IC(50)=25.8 micromol/L for COX-2). Following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56% (COX-1) and 83% (COX-2). Acetaminophen plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro IC(50) for COX-2 for at least 5 h postadministration. Ex vivo IC(50) values (COX-1: 105.2 micromol/L; COX-2: 26.3 micromol/L) of acetaminophen compared favorably with its in vitro IC(50) values. In contrast to previous concepts, acetaminophen inhibited COX-2 by more than 80%, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective COX-2 inhibitors. However, a >95% COX-1 blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. Our data may explain acetaminophen's analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with NSAIDs.

Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. S1P activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 and the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of PI3K and Akt suppressed S1P-induced nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin. We further investigated the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, since \u03b2-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. S1P increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.",

Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that not only PPARgamma ligands but also NSAIDs, which could induce apoptosis, increased the activation of PPARgamma in synovial cells. Furthermore, the ability of NSAIDs and PPARgamma ligands to stimulate the activation of PPARgamma correlated with their ability to decrease cell viability(r = 0.92, p < 0.01) and ability to induce DNA fragmentation (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) in synovial cells.

The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities.

In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo \"pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure.

Butyrylcholinesterase in-creases as Alzheimer disease progresses, so its inhibition may become more important as the disease worsens. Metabolism of rivastigmine occurs at the synapse rather than at the liver and previous studies have demonstrated no drug-drug interactions. Rivastigmine has a half-life at the synapse of 9 hours allowing for bid dosing. REVIEW SUMMARY: Effective therapy requires up-titration from initial dosage of 3 mg/d to 6 mg/d with additional increases to 9 mg or 12 mg/d giving additional benefits in some patients. Beneficial effects with rivastigmine therapy in the functioning of activities of daily living, behavior, cognition, and global functioning have been demonstrated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease in 4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Potential adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in these original Alzheimer trials with rapid (every week) dosage increases occurred in up to 34% of patients and can be minimized by slower monthly up-titrations. Rivastigmine also was proven effective in decreasing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with diffuse Lewy body disease. Other studies have suggested that rivastigmine improves symptoms in nursing home patients with more severe stage Alzheimer disease, Parkinson dementia, and subcortical dementia. Follow-up studies have suggested that rivastigmine may delay disease progression and, in patients discontinuing the drug, no withdrawal effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Rivastigmine is an effective therapeutic agent for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer disease and diffuse Lewy body disease and may also have beneficial effects in vascular and Parkinson dementias.",

First, addition of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a direct acceptor of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-secreted lipids, increased alpha-tocopherol secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Second, probucol, an antiatherogenic compound reported to be an inactivator of ABCA1 reduced hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion. Third, ABCA1-RNAi suppressed hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion.

Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cardiac (c)TnCs containing F27W and did not necessarily mirror the fiber Ca(2+) sensitivity. Circular dichroism of mutant cTnCs revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were as follows: 1) cTnC mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM, and DCM mutations; 2) a region in cTnC associated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers was identified; and 3) the F27W reporter mutation affected Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force, and ATPase activation of some mutants.",

In the present study, four forms of V. affinis phospholipase A(1) were identified through a proteomics approach. Two of these enzymes were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and their biochemical properties were characterised. These enzymes, designated Ves a 1s, are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 Da proteins, which corresponded with the 34-kDa band observed via SDS-PAGE. The thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom. Using an in vivo assay, no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms. Furthermore, the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their PLA(1) activity. The cDNAs of the full-length version of Ves a 1s revealed that the Ves a 1 gene consists of a 1005-bp ORF, which encodes 334 amino acid residues, and 67- and 227-bp 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. The two isoforms are different by three nucleotide substitutions, resulting in the replacement of two amino acids. Through sequence alignment, these enzymes were classified as members of the pancreatic lipase family. The structural modelling of Ves a 1 used the rat pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (1bu8A) as a template because it has PLA(1) activity, which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold family. The Ves a 1 structure, which is composed of seven \u03b1-helixes and eleven \u03b2-strands, contains the \u03b2-strand/\u025bSer/\u03b1-helix structural motif, which contains the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly consensus sequence. The typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity (the lid domain and the \u03b29 loop) were shortened in the Ves a 1 structure, which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit phospholipase activity. Moreover, the observed insertion of proline into the lid domain of the Ves a 1 structure is rare. We therefore propose that this proline residue might be involved in the stability and activity of Ves a 1s.",

IGFBP-rP1 (MAC25/Angiomodulin/prostacyclin-stimulating factor) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. We have previously shown that IGFBP-rP1 is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and by poorly tumorigenic P69SV40T cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and M12 cells. We now show that IGFBP-rP1 increases during senescence of HPEC. IGFBP-rP2 (also known as connective tissue growth factor), a downstream effector of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of IGFBP-rP2 during senescence of HPEC. Moreover, IGFBP-rP2 noticeably increased in response to TGF-beta1 and all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in HPEC and PC-3 cells, and it decreased in response to IGF-I in HPEC. IGFBP-rP3 [nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV)], the protein product of the NOV protooncogene, was not detected in HPEC but was expressed in the tumorigenic DU145 and PC-3 cells. It was also synthesized by the SV40-T antigen-transformed P69 and malignant M12 cells, where it was down-regulated by atRA. These observations suggest biological roles of IGFBP-rPs in the human prostate. IGFBP-rP1 and IGFBP-rP2 are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (TGF-beta1 and atRA). Although the data collected on IGFBP-rP3 in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by atRA.",

The current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of etomidate with alpha2-adrenoceptors in mice lacking individual alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2-KO). METHODS: Sedative and cardiovascular responses to etomidate and the alpha2-agonist, dexmedetomidine, were determined in mice deficient in alpha2-receptor subtypes. Inhibition of binding of the alpha2-receptor antagonist [3H]RX821002 to recombinant alpha2-receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of etomidate in wild-type and in alpha2A-receptor-deficient mice, indicating that the hypnotic effect of etomidate in mice does not require the alpha2A-receptor subtype. Intravenous injection of etomidate resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 +/- 0.2 min) in arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 +/- 3 mmHg). Etomidate did not affect blood pressure in alpha2B-KO or alpha2AB-KO mice. In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with alpha2-receptors, etomidate inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, [3H]RX821002, with higher potency from alpha2B- and alpha2C-receptors than from alpha2A-receptors (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm). In alpha2B-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, etomidate rapidly increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinases ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that etomidate acts as an agonist at alpha2-adrenoceptors, which appears in vivo primarily as an alpha2B-receptor-mediated increase in blood pressure. This effect of etomidate may contribute to the cardiovascular stability of patients after induction of anesthesia with etomidate.",

In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effect of prunetin on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage and LPS-induced septic shock model were investigated. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) expressions were determined by western blot and or realtime-PCR (RT-PCR).

In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of prunetin were evaluated in LPS-induced endotoxemia. Promoter assay revealed that prunetin inhibits LPS-induced nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 production through the suppression of iNOS and COX-2 at the transcriptional level. In addition, prunetin inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory responses by modulating I\u03baB kinase (IKK)-inhibitor \u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1)-NF-\u03baB signaling.

Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. The above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.",

Epinastine (WAL 801CL) is an antihistaminic drug with binding affinity at certain other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic receptors and various serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes. It is used in asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action remains to be fully defined. We have investigated whether epinastine could modulate the eNANC contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro, and have tried to elucidate its receptor mechanism. Epinastine (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7% at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined 5-HT1/5-HT2 antagonists, methysergide (1 microM) or methiothepin (0.1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of epinastine on the noncholinergic contraction. Pretreatment with tropisetron (1 microM), a 5-HT3 antagonist, ketanserin (10 microM), a 5-HT2 antagonist, thioperamide (10 microM), a histamine H3 antagonist, or phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect. Chlorpheniramine (10 microM), another histamine H1 receptor antagonist without significant 5-HT receptor binding affinity, did not produce any inhibition of the eNANC contraction. Epinastine (100 microM) did not displace the dose-response curve to exogenously applied substance P (0.01-10 microM). These results suggest that epinastine, although identified as a 5-HT antagonist, acts as a 5-HT1 agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional 5-HT1-like receptor, located to sensory nerves.",

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

While the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current AD therapies. Memantine can interact with a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. However, NMDA receptors appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. Memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) NMDA receptor antagonist. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition, memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. Blockade of NMDA receptors by memantine could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in AD by inhibiting the \"weak\" NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and possibly inhibits Abeta production. Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of memantine over other NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine, MK-801). A variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). These factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of glutamate--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.",

Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of ethidium homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells.

The change in the AUC of DXM was significantly correlated with the Cmax and AUC of baicalin (P<0.05). The inhibitory effects of multiple doses of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v., 12days) on the metabolism of DXM were similar to those observed following a single dose in rats. The activity of CYP3A in excised liver samples from rats following multiple baicalin treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (P<0.05), whereas multiple doses of baicalin had no obvious effect on the activity of CYP2D.

These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.",

The cAMP phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively.

Calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. These observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin.

Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. S1P activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 and the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of PI3K and Akt suppressed S1P-induced nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin. We further investigated the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, since \u03b2-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. S1P increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.",

Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the LPS induced TNF release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced TNF release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner.

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural, dimethylated analog of resveratrol with higher bioavailability. While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, PTE is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a novel mechanism of action for PTE during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.",

Transporter-enzyme interplay was studied with several in vitro models of varying complexity: rat small intestine and Caco-2 cell monolayers were used in studies of intestinal processes, and hepatic pharmacokinetics was monitored in HepG2 cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver slices. Garlic phytochemicals from aged garlic extract modified the activities of secretory and absorptive transporters in both intestine and liver and competitively inhibited CYP3A4 enzyme.

TAS-102 currently undergoing clinical trials, has been demonstrated to have at least two mechanisms, inhibition of TS and incorporation into DNA. We hypothesized that the thymidine metabolism enzyme may be a crucial factor that affects the antitumor activity of TAS-102. In the present study, we measured the enzyme activity of thymidine kinase (TK), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and thymidilate synthase (TS) in human cancer xenografts to investigate the contribution of these enzymes to the sensitivity of TAS-102. Antitumor activity of TAS-102 appears to be associated with TK, tumor growth and TS. However, the most related factors in this study were the TK and TP ratio. There was a significant correlation (p=0.04) between tumor growth inhibition and this ratio. These results suggested that the activation and degradation pattern of FTD plays an important role in the efficacy of TAS-102 and that it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict response to TAS-102 therapy. We also studied the influence of TPI on the capacity of exogenous dThd to reverse FTD-dependent growth inhibition. Thymidine (dThd) levels rescued the effect of FTD in vitro and significantly increased in serum after administration of TAS-102 or TPI alone but not FTD alone. This may suggest the possibility of a decrease in antitumor effect. However, our study indicated that the therapeutic index was clearly increased by FTD combined with TPI, compared with FTD alone, suggesting FTD-induced toxicity to sensitive host tissue can be selectively reversed with dThd. In conclusion, TK and TPI effects on TP play important roles in the cytotoxic action of TAS-102, and it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict more precisely individual resistance or sensitivity.",

Only in the last couple of years a consensus has been reached on what constitutes the main role of BH4 in NO synthesis. In this review we aim to provide an outline of the various ways in which BH4 affects NOS catalysis. First we give a brief general description of the structure and catalytic mechanism of NOS, with special emphasis on those aspects of catalysis that are actively debated, and that directly or indirectly involve BH4. Foremost among those issues is uncoupled catalysis, i.e. the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of NADPH in the absence of substrate or pterin that does not result in NO production. We also shortly discuss the ongoing debate on whether NO is the actual reaction product of NOS catalysis, as well as the phenomenon of NO-mediated autoinhibition. We describe the function of BH4 in aromatic amino acid hydroxylation, and discuss the allosteric and structural effects that BH4 exerts on NOS. Next we turn our attention to what is now becoming accepted as the central function of BH4: its capacity to act as a 1-electron donor during reductive activation of the oxyferrous complex of the heme. Finally, we illustrate how BH4 might transform the NOS dimer into an efficient S-nitrosoglutathione synthase,and briefly touch on some more speculative aspects of the role of BH4 in NO synthesis.",

Levels of Cx43 protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following antofine treatment. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that antofine (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where Cx43 was co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1. Inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with antofine and their respective specific inhibitors, NH4Cl or MG132, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in Cx43 protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of GJIC.

In addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of Ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the Ras/RAF pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits C-RAF kinase was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF (wild type and V600E mutant). It inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of sorafenib revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and Kit), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling). In phase I and phase II clinical trials, sorafenib showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization.

Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR. Here we report that in the absence of flanking sequences, isolated Ig module II of FGFR1 supports the binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 in respective order of affinity. None of the three FGFs detectably bind Ig module I or the IIIb and IIIc splice variants of Ig module III in the absence of flanking sequences. Ig module I and the C-terminus of Ig module III are dispensable for high-affinity binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Alterations in highly conserved Ig module II in the heparin binding domain and substitution of individual sequence domains spanning the entire sequence of Ig module II with those from Ig module I obliterated FGF binding. Addition of a specific number of FGFR sequences to the C-terminus of Ig module II resulted in a gain in affinity for FGF-7. Several site-specific alterations in the C-terminus of full-length FGFR1IIIc, an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects FGF-7, resulted in gain of FGF-7 binding.

Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular T2R bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-K. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, TRPV1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, TRPV1 activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using Ca(2+) imaging on TRPV1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate TRPV1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that TRPV1 receptors are activated by CuSO(4), ZnSO(4), and FeSO(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate TRPV1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.",

AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.",

LY541850 was claimed from human mGlu receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist. We have verified this pharmacological profile of LY541850 in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the temporo-ammonic path (TAP) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) were inhibited by LY541850 in mGlu3-/- mice (EC(50) 38 nM) and wild-type littermates (EC(50) 42 nM) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in mGlu2-/- mice. The group II agonist, DCG-IV, inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes. Co-application of DCG-IV and LY541850 in mGlu3-/- and wild-type littermates resulted in an additive effect, whereas in mGlu2-/- mice, LY541850 reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV. These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist actions of LY541850. A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus. Systemic administration of LY541850 to wild-type mice, reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both phencyclidine and amphetamine administration. These data support the hypothesis that mGlu2 receptors mediate the antipsychotic effects of mixed group II agonists.

Herein, cellular IFN\u03b1/IL-22 interactions are investigated. We report that pre-conditioning of epithelial cells with IFN\u03b1 initiated dramatic changes in IL-22 signaling normally dominated by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3. Specifically, by using human DLD1 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells we demonstrate that, upon IFN\u03b1, IL-22 converts into a cytokine robustly activating STAT1 and its downstream pro-inflammatory targets CXCL9, CXCL10, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

Butein, a plant polyphenol, is one of the major active components of R. verniciflua. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced via dental adhesive bleaching agents and pulpal disease, can cause oxidative stress. Here, we found that butein possesses cytoprotective effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced dental cell death. H2O2 is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of butein, and these effects were dose dependent. Butein also increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and HO activity. In addition, butein-dependent HO-1 expression was required for the inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, butein treatment caused nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the promoter activity of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation.

In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG) island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and expression.",

We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of GAL bound in the active site of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) to 2.3 A resolution.

The tertiary amine group of GAL does not interact closely with Trp-84; rather, the double bond of its cyclohexene ring stacks against the indole ring.

The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 A) with Glu-199.

Terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. Like other histamine H1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. Terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. Acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. Infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain.

These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization.

In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors.

Theophylline exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mRNA expression for CysS and PDE3A, but PDE4D gene expression was unchanged. Our results suggest that submaxillary hypertrophy is primarily caused by the enhanced transcription of CysS, and that the transcription of each PDE subfamily gene is regulated differently.",

The drug has been reported to interact with various ion channel types, including AMPA/kainate receptors. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala, topiramate at low concentrations (IC50, approximately 0.5 microm) selectively inhibited pharmacologically isolated excitatory synaptic currents mediated by kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit. Topiramate also partially depressed predominantly AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs, but with lower efficacy. Topiramate did not alter the degree of facilitation in paired-pulse experiments, and it reduced the amplitude of miniature EPSCs without affecting their frequency, demonstrating that the block of synaptic responses occurs postsynaptically. Inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptors could represent a key mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant activity of topiramate. Moreover, these results support the concept that GluR5 kainate receptors represent a novel target for antiepileptic drug development.",

Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.",

Nevertheless, 3 mM DMA, a higher concentration that inhibits NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3, significantly increased DBS. Moreover, S1611 and S3226, both specific inhibitors of NHE3 only, or perfusion with Na+-free solutions, dose dependently increased DBS, as measured by pH-stat and CO2-sensitive electrode, without affecting intracellular pH.

Nevertheless, coperfusion with 0.1 and 0.3 mM 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, which inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR), dose dependently inhibited S3226-induced DBS. In conclusion, only specific apical NHE3 inhibition increased DBS, whereas prostaglandin synthesis, Na+-HCO3- cotransporter activation, or intracellular HCO3- formation by carbonic anhydrase was not involved. Because NHE3 inhibition-increased DBS was inhibited by an anion channel inhibitor and because reciprocal CFTR regulation has been previously shown between NHE3 and apical membrane anion transporters, we speculate that NHE3 inhibition increased DBS by altering anion transporter function.",

Adenosine, an enzymatic ATP degradation product, acts at prejunctional A1 adenosine receptors (A1Rs) to inhibit NE release. We tested the hypothesis that prejunctional A1R function is impaired in sympathetic nerves supplying mesenteric arteries (MAs) and veins (MVs) of DOCA-salt rats. Electrically evoked NE release and constrictions of blood vessels were studied in vitro with use of amperometry to measure NE oxidation currents and video microscopy, respectively. Immunohistochemical methods were used to localize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and A1Rs in perivascular sympathetic nerves. TH and A1Rs colocalized to perivascular sympathetic nerves. Adenosine and N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA, A1R agonist) constricted MVs but not MAs. Adenosine and CPA (0.001-10 \u00b5M) inhibited neurogenic constrictions and NE release in MAs and MVs.

The A2A adenosine receptor agonist CGS21680 (C23H29N7O6.HCl.xH2O) (0.001-0.1 \u03bcM) did not alter NE oxidation currents. We conclude that there are prejunctional A1Rs in arteries and both pre- and postjunctional A1Rs in veins; thus, adenosine selectively constricts the veins. Prejunctional A1R function is impaired in arteries, but not veins, from DOCA-salt rats.

A very similar change was observed in the value of B beta 15-42 (P less than 0.01). These observations indicated that EIS provokes transient activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In vitro studies, however, revealed that EO inhibits fibrin clot formation because of the Ca2+-chelating ability of its constituent ethanolamine, although oleate or benzyl alcohol exhibited procoagulant activity in FPA formation in vitro. Nevertheless, an external application of EO or oleate over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a significant accumulation of 125I-labelled fibrin(ogen). From these results it was suggested that intravascular injection of EO, which exerts an inhibitory effect on coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system.

These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way. Although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular ACTH-secreting mechanisms, an influence of loperamide on some suprapituitary factors modulating the ACTH response is suggested.",

The genes and signaling pathways affected by TCDD that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD. Thus, the TCDD-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and Rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of TCDD-exposed UGS organ cultures with RSPO2 and/or RSPO3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of TCDD on canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that KIT is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance.

The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm.

We now show that heregulin (HRG), but not EGF, stimulates p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, phospho-p95ErbB2 forms heterodimers with ErbB3, but not EGFR, while p185ErbB2 heterodimerizes with both EGFR and ErbB3. The predilection of p95ErbB2 to heterodimerize with ErbB3 provides an explanation for its regulation by HRG, an ErbB3 ligand. GW572016, a reversible small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, inhibits baseline p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 cells and tumor xenografts. Inhibition of p95ErbB2, p185ErbB2, and EGFR phosphorylation by GW572016 resulted in the inhibition of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, and cyclin D steady-state protein levels. Increased phosphorylation of p95ErbB2 and AKT in response to HRG was abrogated to varying degrees by GW572016. In contrast, trastuzumab did not inhibit p95ErbB2 phosphorylation or the expression of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, or cyclin D. It is tempting to speculate that trastuzumab resistance may be mediated in part by the selection of p95ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells capable of exerting potent growth and prosurvival signals through p95ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers. Thus, p95ErbB2 represents a target for therapeutic intervention, and one that is sensitive to GW572016 therapy.",

Phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin, DPH) is an established sodium channel blocker and is a useful anticonvulsant and class 1b antiarrhythmic, and has been effectively used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we have synthesized novel alpha-hydroxyphenylamide analogues of diphenylhydantoin and examined their ability to inhibit human Na(V)1.5 sodium channels expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Phenyl ring substitutions were examined including para-methyl, para-fluoro, para-chloro, ortho-chloro and meta-chloro. We have found that phenyl ring substitutions with electron withdrawing properties resulted in compounds with greater activity. In comparison to diphenylhydantoin, the novel chloro-substituted alpha-hydroxyphenylamide compounds produced as much as a 20-fold greater tonic and frequency-dependent blockade of Na(V)1.5 channels with an IC(50) value of 14.5 microM. In addition, the chloro-substitutions have position specific state dependent blocking properties. The ortho-, meta- and para-chloro substitutions have an 8-, 13- and 3-fold increased affinity for the inactivated state, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that these differences in affinity are due to a direct interaction with the receptor. Comparing models of diphenylhydantoin to the novel alpha-hydroxyphenlyamide compound suggests that the increased activity may be due to an optimized phenyl ring position and increased molecular volume. This information may be useful in the development of more potent sodium channel blockers.",

We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 \u03bcM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation.

There is no single ChE reactivator having an ability to reactivate sufficiently the inhibited enzyme due to the high variability of chemical structure of the inhibitors. The difficulties in reactivation of ChE activity and slight antidote effect regarding intoxication with some OPC are some of the reasons for continuous efforts to obtain new reactivators of ChE. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of some ChE reactivators against OPC intoxication (tabun, paraoxon and dichlorvos) in in vitro experiments and to compare their activity to that known for some currently used oximes (obidoxime, HI-6, 2-PAM). Experiments were carried out using rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Reactivators showed different activity in the reactivation of rat brain AChE after dichlorvos, paraoxon and tabun inhibition. AChE was easier reactivated after paraoxon treatment. The best effect showed BT-07-4M, obidoxime, TMB-4 and BT-08 from the group of symmetric oximes, and Toxidin, BT-05 and BT-03 from asymmetric compounds. The reactivation of brain AChE inhibited with tabun demonstrated better activity of new compound BT-07-4M, TMB-4 and obidoxime from symmetric oximes, and BT-05 and BT-03 possessing asymmetric structure.

Mechanical allodynia was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Subcutaneous treatment of the animals with CP-101,606 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Intracerebroventricular injection of CP-101,606 at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. However, intrathecal injection of CP-101,606 at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit CCI-induced allodynia. A receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that [3H]CP-101,606 bound to the brain NR2B receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. These findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of CP-101,606 is ascribable to blockade of NR2B receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective NMDA antagonist, memantine, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective NMDA antagonist and the NR2B-specific NMDA antagonist.",

To determine whether these responses were common to other amphetamines of abuse, effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the plasmalemmal DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) were assessed. Similar to effects of METH reported previously, multiple high-dose MDMA administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal DA uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple METH injections, 1) MDMA caused little or no decrease in binding of the DAT ligand WIN35428, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of DA prevented the MDMA-induced reduction in plasmalemmal DA transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by MDMA in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting DAT function, MDMA rapidly decreased vesicular DA transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of MDMA and previously reported METH on DAT and VMAT-2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.",

The cAMP phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively. The oxidized and t-butyl analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the basal (Ca2+/calmodulin-independent) activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase as well as the calmodulin-stimulated activity. Calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. These observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (IC50 = 17.4 microM), whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kD light chain (IC50 = 12.6 microM) or intact myosin (IC50 = 11.0 microM) was used as substrate. Inhibition in each case was prevented by excess calmodulin. The oxidized and t-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition. Finally, the effects of felodipine and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin and the assembly of myosin filaments. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin (IC50 = 25.1 microM). The oxidized and t-butyl analogues exhibited no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not. Again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase and myosin filament assembly by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. These observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of felodipine on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.",

METHODS: Twenty-one Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Subjects had been treated with voglibose for at least 3 months. They underwent a 400 kcal balanced food meal tolerance test before and 8 weeks after the changeover from voglibose to acarbose. Subjects were divided into two groups: the first group (low-dose group; n=11) was changed over from 0.6 mg/day voglibose to 150 mg/day acarbose, and the other (high-dose group; n=10) from 0.9 mg/day voglibose to 300 mg/day acarbose. RESULTS: The increment rate of postprandial plasma glucose ([plasma glucose 2 hours after test meal - fasting glucose]/fasting glucose) decreased from 34.7%+/-23.9% to 25.0%+/-24.6% (P=0.13) in the low-dose group, and decreased significantly from 56.1%+/-53.1% to 31.5%+/-36.0% (P=0.03) in the high-dose group after changeover. However, there were no significant changes in blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels before and after changeover in either group. The increment rate of postprandial serum triglyceride (TG) ([serum TG 2 hours after test meal - fasting TG]/fasting TG) decreased significantly only in the high-dose group (52.4%+/-60.0% to 24.3%+/-16.6%) (P=0.05). No significant changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in either group, whereas serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly from 3.20+/-0.25 to 2.65+/-0.18 mmol/L (P=0.04), only in the high-dose group.

    "abstract": "Effect of antidepressant drugs in mice lacking the norepinephrine transporter.\nOne of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic NE availability by inhibition of the reuptake of NE. Using mice lacking NE transporter (NET-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the NET-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP12177 in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular NE levels observed in these mice. A pronounced NET knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by NET-inhibiting ADs such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. Citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the NET, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the NET-/- mice. In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the NET may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular NE.",

With molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3H]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.",

METHODS: 12 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. They received carvedilol at daily doses of 1-20 mg with a 1-2 weekly adjustment. Serum carvedilol trough concentrations were measured in steady-state using a specific fluorescence HPLC method. The degree of improvement in heart failure was assessed from the ratio of change in the plasma BNP concentration, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the commencement of carvedilol administration. RESULTS: From the pharmacokinetic aspect, there was no valid correlation between the trough serum carvedilol concentration (Cmin) and daily dose per body weight (Dd/BW), indicating that there was a wide difference in the carvedilol elimination capacity among individuals. A significant decrease in the BNP was observed at the 3rd month in patients treated with the high dose (> 750 mg/3 months). On the other hand, in patients with a mean serum carvedilol level (Cmin) of less than 2.5 nmol/l up to 2 weeks after the start ofcarvedilol therapy, the degree of reduction in the BNP value after the 3rd month was significantly larger, relative to the patient group with Cmin over 2.5 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The total carvedilol dose was confirmed to be one of the determinants for improvement in heart failure, and it was suggested that the initial serum level also plays an important role in therapeutic outcome.

Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells.

Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation.

Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

We examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and IL-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins were potent inhibitors of iNOS induction and were more effective than their precursors, prostaglandins E2 and D2. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was the most potent prostaglandin among those tested. In activated microglia, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed iNOS promoter activity, iNOS mRNA, and protein levels. The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.",

Nox4 oxidase activity is thought to be constitutive and regulated at the transcriptional level; however, we challenge this point of view and suggest that specific quinone derivatives could modulate this activity. In fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of Nox4 activity by 4 quinone derivatives (AA-861, tBuBHQ, tBuBQ, and duroquinone) observed in 3 different cellular models, HEK293E, T-REx\u2122, and chondrocyte cell lines. Our results indicate that the effect is specific toward Nox4 versus Nox2. Furthermore, we showed that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) may participate in this stimulation. Interestingly, Nox4 activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the disulfide bridge (Cys226, Cys270) located in the extracellular E-loop of Nox4. Such model of Nox4 activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which quinones and Nox4 are implicated.",

I3A bound to PKC-alpha in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little PKC isoform selectivity was observed.

I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance.

Several studies have suggested that cinobufagin has potent anti-cancer effects. The present study examines the apoptosis-inducing activity and the underlying mechanism of action of cinobufagin in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells. Among them, xIAP, cIAP-1, survivin and Bcl-2 levels decreased remarkably, while the levels of Bax and cleaved-PARP increased. Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3\u03b2 could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment. However, combined treatment with cinobufagin and SB216367 resulted in a significant reduction in p65 and an increase in cleaved-PARP in U2OS cells. Altogether, these results show that cinobufagin is a promising agent for the treatment of OS.

Low temperatures induced an accumulation of total anthocyanin content in the skin of both treated and non-treated grapes, although levels were lower in CO2-treated fruit.

Mice fed long term with griseofulvin are an animal model of MB formation. However, the lack of a cellular model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process. Culture of HepG2 cells with griseofulvin has now been shown to induce both the formation of intracellular aggregates containing K18 as well as an increase in the abundance of K18 mRNA. Overexpression of K18 in HepG2, HeLa, or COS-7 cells also induced the formation of intracellular aggregates that stained with antibodies to ubiquitin and with rhodamine B (characteristics of MBs formed in vivo), eventually leading to cell death. The MB-like aggregates were deposited around centrosomes and disrupted the microtubular array. Coexpression of K8 with K18 restored the normal fibrous pattern of keratin distribution and reduced the toxicity of K18. In contrast, an NH(2)-terminal deletion mutant of K8 promoted the formation of intracellular aggregates even in the absence of K18 overexpression. Deregulated expression of K18, or an imbalance between K8 and K18, may thus be an important determinant of MB formation, which compromises the function of centrosomes and the microtubule network and leads to cell death.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of dasatinib (BMS-354825): a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL.\nPURPOSE: Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in imatinib-acquired resistance and intolerance. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.",

This property has made GAL the target of research as to its effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of GAL bound in the active site of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) to 2.3 A resolution. The inhibitor binds at the base of the active site gorge of TcAChE, interacting with both the choline-binding site (Trp-84) and the acyl-binding pocket (Phe-288, Phe-290). The tertiary amine group of GAL does not interact closely with Trp-84; rather, the double bond of its cyclohexene ring stacks against the indole ring. The tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional hydrogen bond, via its N-methyl group, to Asp-72, near the top of the gorge. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 A) with Glu-199. The relatively tight binding of GAL to TcAChE appears to arise from a number of moderate to weak interactions with the protein, coupled to a low entropy cost for binding due to the rigid nature of the inhibitor.",

Similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibit DA uptake in rodent and monkey brain. Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and DAT effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. Dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to DAT occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). DAT occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (FECNT). DAT occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular DA in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in DA and DAT occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with DAT effects determined with in vivo techniques. The results further support a role for the DAT in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.",

(Review).\nAspirin is a salicylate drug that is extensively used for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and anti-thrombotic effects. More recently, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. In most cases, aspirin is relatively safe. However, it does cause a host of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Although the inhibition of cyclooxygenases by aspirin, which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet ill-defined. Studies over the past decades suggest that, besides cyclooxygenases, aspirin acetylates other cellular proteins. These studies used radiolabeled 3H or 14C aspirin, the only approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated by aspirin. In a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of aspirin to acetylate the tumor suppressor protein p53. In this review, we present current research from the literature on the aspirin-induced acetylation of proteins. We also describe an immunological approach to detecting acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells, and demonstrate that multiple proteins are acetylated. Since post-translational modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of aspirin could occur as a result of these modifications. The identification of these novel acetylation targets of aspirin represents a new area for investigation.",

METHODS: Ethanol was given in drinking water at the concentration of 6 % (v/v), for one month. Changes in the levels of CREB and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein in the nucleus accumbens were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: Ethanol given to rats in drinking water decreased the level of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (-75 %) at the time of exposure to ethanol. The decrement of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens remained at 24 h (-35 %) and 72 h (-28 %) of ethanol withdrawal, which recovered toward control level after 7 d of ethanol withdrawal. However, chronic ethanol, as well as ethanol withdrawal failed to produce any significant alteration in the level of CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. Naloxone (alone) treatment of rats had no effect on the levels of CREB and p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. However, when naloxone was administered concurrently with ethanol treatment, it antagonized the down-regulation of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (142 %) of rats exposed to ethanol. CONCLUSION: A long-term intake of ethanol solution down-regulates the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens, and those changes can be reversed by naloxone, which may be one kind of the molecular mechanisms associated with ethanol dependence.",

To investigate ways of overcoming 5-FU-resistance, we established acquired-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines against these three drugs by continuous and step-wise escalation of drugs, and analyzed the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of resistance to the drugs. When cells were incubated with the 3 drugs for 72 h, the resistance ratio to parental DLD-1 human colorectal tumor cells was 65.2 for DLD-1/5-FU, 9.7 for DLD-1/FdUrd and 448.6 for DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells. DLD-1/5-FU cells did not show any cross-resistance against FdUrd and F(3)dThd. However, DLD-1/FdUrd cells showed 3- and 9-fold increased resistance to 5-FU and F3(d)Thd, respectively, and DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells also showed about 90-fold resistance to FdUrd. Analysis of enzyme activities and gene expression associated with pyrimidine metabolism indicated that a significant decrease in orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activity in DLD-1/5-FU cells, a 7-fold increase of TS mRNA in DLD-1/FdUrd cells, and a 37-fold decrease in thymidine kinase activity of DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells were the major mechanisms of drug resistance. These findings were closely associated with the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, FdUrd and F3(d)Thd against the established 5-FU-, FdUrd- or F3(d)Thd-resistant cells. When DLD-1/FdUrd cells expressing increased TS mRNA were treated with FdUrd and F3(d)Thd for only 4 h, the resistance ratios of DLD-1/FdUrd cells to parental DLD-1 cells were markedly different for FdUrd and F3(d)Thd, suggesting that the cytotoxicity with short-time exposure to F3(d)Thd is due to a mechanism other than TS inhibition, although the cytotoxicity of F3(d)Thd in the short-time is low compared to that of long-time exposure. In conclusion, F3(d)Thd, an antimetabolite that inhibits TS activity, may be effective against 5-FU and/or FdUrd-resistance in colorectal cancer cells caused by amplification of TS and/or deletion of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase.",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including sulindac are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. Sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. Sulindac induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several ERK1/2 effectors, including the proapoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Ser112 by ERK1/2 inactivates Bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. Sulindac metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. In this study we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) strongly induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Bad in HT29 colon cancer cells. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and Bad is blocked by pretreatment with U0126, a selective MAP kinase kinase (MKK)1/2 inhibitor. Similarly, pretreatment with sulindac sulfide blocks the ability of EGF to induce ERK1/2 and Bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total Bad but not ERK1/2 protein levels. The ability of sulindac to block ERK1/2 signaling by the EGF receptor may account for at least part of its potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.",

Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT1F receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of sumatriptan with those of a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist (LY 344864) on c-fos protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos expression was induced in urethane-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal capsaicin administration.

The effect of sumatriptan, but not of LY 344864, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist SDZ 21-009, which displays high affinity for rat 5-HT1B receptors. LY 344864 appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via 5-HT1F receptors, while sumatriptan acts via 5-HT1B receptors.

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. Thus, we found that 5HHMF enhances heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. In addition, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a specific HO-1 inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of 5HHMF on LPS-induced NO production. Further, 5HHMF increased specific DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, and transient knockdown with Nrf2 siRNA subsequently reversed 5HHMF-induced NO inhibition, which was followed by suppression of HO-1 activity.

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1.

Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation.

These results indicate that U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves GRK-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-, rab5-, and rab7-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation. Thus, U50,488H-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both rab5 and rab7 in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor. In addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of proteasomes in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor.",

Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced PGE2 production. The prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced PGE2 production in BE, however, is not known. We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES mRNA. Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and thymidine incorporation. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-\u03baB-Luc. Knockdown of NF-\u03baB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production.

In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of sinapic acid on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced chronic liver injury in rats. Sinapic acid remarkably prevented DMN-induced loss of body weight. This was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and liver malondialdehyde content. Furthermore, sinapic acid reduced hepatic hydroxyproline content, which correlated with a reduction in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and histological analysis of collagen in liver tissue. Additionally, the expression of hepatic fibrosis-related factors such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), were reduced in rats treated with sinapic acid. Sinapic acid exhibited strong scavenging activity. In conclusion, we find that sinapic acid exhibits hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, most likely due to its antioxidant activities of scavenging radicals, its capacity to suppress TGF-\u03b21 and its ability to attenuate activation of hepatic stellate cells. This suggests that sinapic acid is a potentially useful agent for the protection against liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.",

Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.",

It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these oxysterols on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7KC or 7\u03b2OHC inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, mitochondrial depolarization involving Mcl-1, and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, under treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with Fura-2, no significant Ca(2+) rise was found with the different oxysterols, whereas strong signals were detected with ionomycin used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, 7KC but not 7\u03b2OHC accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, 27OHC was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that \u03b1-tocopherol (but not ellagic acid and resveratrol) was able to counteract 7KC- and 7\u03b2OHC-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of 7KC and 27OHC in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of oxysterols to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GSK-3 and caspase-3 activation is independent of the increase in the Ca(2+) level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.",

Heart failure is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, and compounds that increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle to Ca(2+) have therapeutic potential. The Ca(2+)-sensitizer, levosimendan, targets cTnC; however, detailed understanding of its mechanism has been obscured by its instability. In order to understand how this class of positive inotropes function, we investigated the mode of action of two fluorine containing novel analogs of levosimendan; 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yloxy acetic acid (dfbp-o) and 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl acetic acid (dfbp). The affinities of dfbp and dfbp-o for the regulatory domain of cTnC were measured in the absence and presence of cTnI by NMR spectroscopy, and dfbp-o was found to bind more strongly than dfbp. Dfbp-o also increased the affinity of cTnI for cTnC. Dfbp-o increased the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of demembranated cardiac trabeculae in a manner similar to levosimendan. The high resolution NMR solution structure of the cTnC-cTnI-dfbp-o ternary complex showed that dfbp-o bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by cTnC and cTnI making critical interactions with residues such as Arg147 of cTnI. In the absence of cTnI, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.",

Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3. It is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.",

Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine.

Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells.

Also the hepatic Mrp2 (not P-gp) and CYP3A subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced cholestatic (EEC) rats. Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of doxorubicin with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in EEC rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic study of doxorubicin after intravenous administration of its hydrochloride was conducted along with the investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of doxorubicin in control and EEC rats. 3. The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of doxorubicin in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease). The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin. These results might have broader implications to understand the altered pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of doxorubicin via biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical estrogen-induced cholestasis.",

Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 \u03bcM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 \u03bcM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 \u03bcM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 \u03bcM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.",

There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action. It is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects. This article presents the characteristics of selective and non-selective NCX inhibitors and their therapeutic potential as a new calcium regulator.",

Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an EP1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, PGE1>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2. SC-51089 (10(-5) M), a selective EP1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor. The PGE1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) M). PGE1 and PGE2 also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that R-type Ca2+ channels are involved.

PGE(2) is synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four prostanoid receptors EP(1) through EP(4). In this study, we show for the first time that medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, expresses high levels of COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, and EP(1) through EP(4) and secretes PGE(2). PGE(2) and the EP(2) receptor agonist butaprost stimulated MB cell proliferation. Treatment of MB cells with COX inhibitors suppressed PGE(2) production and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, specific COX-2 silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited MB cell growth. EP(1) and EP(3) receptor antagonists ONO-8713 and ONO-AE3-240, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth. Administration of COX inhibitors at clinically achievable nontoxic concentrations significantly inhibited growth of established human MB xenografts. Apoptosis was increased, proliferation was reduced, and angiogenesis was inhibited in MBs treated with COX inhibitors.

Here, we identified Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak) as a molecular target of VK2-induced apoptosis. VK2 directly interacts with Bak and induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Although Bak and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), another member of the Bcl-2 family, are generally thought to be functionally redundant, only Bak is necessary and sufficient for VK2-induced cytochrome c (cyt c) release and cell death. Moreover, VK2-2,3 epoxide, an intracellular metabolite of VK2, was shown to covalently bind to the cysteine-166 residue of Bak. Several lines of evidence suggested that the covalent attachment of VK2 is critical for apoptosis induction. Thus this study reveals a specific role for Bak in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. This study also provides insight into the anticancer effects of VK2 and suggests that Bak may be a potential target of cancer therapy.",

METHODS: Cyclooxygenase activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production following incubation of varying concentrations of NSAID with human recombinant COX-1 or COX-2 and arachidonic acid. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microL (+/-) ketorolac 0.4% (Acular LS) or bromfenac 0.09% (Xibrom) and the other eye with 50 microL buffered saline. In control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. All animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before LPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PGE(2) production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous PGE(2) levels in vivo, measured by ELISA immunoassay. RESULTS: Ketorolac was six times more active against COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.02 microM) than COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.12 microM) while bromfenac was approximately 32 times more active against COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.0066 microM) than COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.210 microM). In the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of FITC-dextran leakage and PGE(2) production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. There was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of FITC-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of bromfenac-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of ketorolac-treated rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Ketorolac is relatively COX-1 selective while bromfenac is potently selective for COX-2 over COX-1. In the animal model, both ketorolac 0.4% and bromfenac 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. Only bromfenac 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.",

Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GPR54-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of kisspeptin stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GPR54 mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GPR54 signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma luteinising hormone (LH) levels and significantly increases plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of kisspeptin results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence kisspeptin has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans.

The early metabolism of mifepristone is characterized by rapid demethylation and hydroxylation. Similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for CDB-2914 (CDB: Contraceptive Development Branch of NICHD) and CDB-4124, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. We have examined the functional activities and potencies, in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (RBAs) for progesterone receptors (PR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) of the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914, CDB-4124, and mifepristone and of the 17alpha-hydroxy and aromatic A-ring derivatives of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124.

The reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of monodemethylated CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 was confirmed in vivo by the thymus involution assay in adrenalectomized male rats. The aromatic A-ring derivatives-stimulated transcription of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in MCF-7 and T47D-CO human breast cancer cells but were much less potent than estradiol. Taken together, these data suggest that the proximal metabolites of mifepristone, CDB-2914, and CDB-4124 contribute significantly to the antiprogestational activity of the parent compounds in vivo. Furthermore, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 compared to mifepristone in vivo may be due in part to decreased activity of their putative proximal metabolites.",

Pharmacol. 62, 1364]. QR2 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of menadione via the oxidation of N-alkylated or N-ribosylated nicotinamides. To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of QR2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of QR2. Importantly, we have shown that QR2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant N-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. Our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the quinolines and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent QR2 inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of QR2.",

However, whether increasing EETs production by CYP2J2 overexpression in vivo could prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unknown. Here we investigated the effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression on angiotensin (Ang) II-induced AAA in apoE-deficient mice. rAAV-CYP2J2 delivery led to an abundant aortic CYP2J2 expression and increased EETs generation. It was shown that CYP2J2 overexpression attenuated matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity, elastin degradation, and AAA formation, which was associated with reduced aortic inflammation and macrophage infiltration. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression and EETs markedly suppressed Ang II-induced inflammatory cytokine expression. Moreover, overexpressed CYP2J2 and EETs inhibited Ang II-induced macrophage migration in a VSMC-macrophage coculture system. We further indicated that these protective effects were mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression prevents AAA development which is likely via PPAR\u03b3 activation and anti-inflammatory action, suggesting that increasing EETs levels could be considered as a potential strategy to prevent and treat AAA.",

Herein, we describe for the first time the effects of PSE on T-cell activation events. We found that PSE inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit was clearly inhibited by PSE in stimulated cells. In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity.

Replacement of NaCl by LiCl or choline chloride abolished transport activity in SHR and WKY PTE cells. In the presence of the system L inhibitor BCH, Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake in WKY and SHR PTE cells was inhibited by alanine, serine, and cysteine, which is consistent with amino acid transport through ASCT2. The saturable component of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine transport under V(max) conditions in SHR PTE cells was one-half of that in WKY PTE cells, with similar K(m) values. Differences in magnitude of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake through ASCT2 between WKY and SHR PTE cells correlated positively with differences in ASCT2 protein expression, this being more abundant in WKY PTE cells.

The early metabolism of mifepristone is characterized by rapid demethylation and hydroxylation. Similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for CDB-2914 (CDB: Contraceptive Development Branch of NICHD) and CDB-4124, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. We have examined the functional activities and potencies, in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (RBAs) for progesterone receptors (PR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) of the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914, CDB-4124, and mifepristone and of the 17alpha-hydroxy and aromatic A-ring derivatives of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124. The binding affinities of the monodemethylated metabolites for rabbit uterine PR and human PR-A and PR-B were similar to those of the parent compounds. Monodemethylated mifepristone bound to rabbit thymic GR with higher affinity than monodemethylated CDB-2914 or CDB-4124. T47D-CO cells were used to assess inhibition of R5020-stimulated endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity and transactivation of the PRE(2)-thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid in transient transfections.

Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.",

In addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of Ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the Ras/RAF pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits C-RAF kinase was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF (wild type and V600E mutant). It inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of sorafenib revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and Kit), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling). In phase I and phase II clinical trials, sorafenib showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization.

The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the above mentioned allergic parameters. METHODS: Rats were sensitized and provocated by TDI and the nasal allergy-like behaviors were scored during a 10 minute period after provocation. Histamine content and HDC activity in the nasal mucosa were determined using fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of HDC mRNA in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In TDI-sensitized rats, nasal allergy-like behaviors such as sneezing and watery rhinorrhea were induced.

Pretreatment with dexamethasone significantly suppressed nasal allergy-like behaviors, up-regulation of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA induced by TDI in TDI-sensitized rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased synthesis of histamine through up-regulation of HDC gene expression and HDC activity in nasal mucosa plays an important role in the development of nasal hypersensitivity.

Astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS).

In the local presence into the LC of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist RS79948 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), systemic citalopram increased NA in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009157\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009175\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0%). Local citalopram (0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcM) into the LC induced NA increase in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and decrease in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-38\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0%). Local LC citalopram effect was abolished by LC presence of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL72222 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) but not the 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (1\u00a0\u03bcM). Systemic citalopram in the LC presence of MDL72222 did not modify NA in the LC but increased NA in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009158\u2009\u00b1\u200926\u00a0%). Local citalopram into the PFC enhanced NA (Emax\u2009=\u2009376\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u00a0%) in the area, which was prevented by MDL72222. CONCLUSIONS: The SSRI citalopram modulates central noradrenergic neurotransmission by activation, through endogenous serotonin, of 5-HT3 receptors expressed in the somatodendritic (LC) and terminal (PFC) areas, which subsequently promote an enhancement of local NA. Therefore, 5-HT3 receptors and somatodendritic \u03b12-adrenoceptors in the LC play an important role in the global effect of SSRIs.",

Therefore, downregulation of microglial activation has a significant therapeutic demand. In this study, focus was given to evaluate the ability of neoechinulin A, an indole alkaloid isolated from marine-derived Microsporum sp., to attenuate microglial activation by oligomeric amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b242). Neoechinulin A treatment significantly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in A\u03b242-activated BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, we found that neoechinulin A significantly suppressed the production of neurotoxic inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in activated BV-2 cells. Moreover, the treatment downregulated the protein and gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Further, activated microglia-mediated apoptosis of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells was significantly repressed by neoechinulin A. The molecular mechanism studies suggested that neoechinulin A may block the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) molecule p38, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 and p50 subunits. Regulation of these signalling pathways have most probably contributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of neoechinulin A. Collectively, these results suggest that with further studies neoechinulin A have a potential to be developed as a modulator of neuroinflammatory process in AD.",

Currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. Thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to vinblastine was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor, activation of caspase-9 and 3, and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose)-Polymerase. Also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of Ras homologous protein A, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular Ca(2+), as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappaB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1.

Moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for Rho A in the regulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study addresses for the first time a central role for Rho A in the modulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells and thereby provides an insight into the molecular action of vinblastine in melanoma treatment.",

Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of ethidium homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells. Also, ursolic acid enhanced the cleavages of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase3, attenuated the expression of astrocyte elevated gene (AEG1) and survivin in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, ursolic acid increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and coenzyme A carboxylase and also enhanced phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at inactive form serine 9, whereas ursolic acid attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in HepG2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C or GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 blocked the cleavages of PARP and caspase 3 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, proteosomal inhibitor MG132 suppressed AMPK activation, GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, cleaved PARP and deceased AEG-1 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells.

The genes and signaling pathways affected by TCDD that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD. Thus, the TCDD-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and Rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of TCDD-exposed UGS organ cultures with RSPO2 and/or RSPO3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of TCDD on canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation. We discovered that each RSPO alone or in combination partially rescues TCDD inhibition of both canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.",

ABCA1 mediates the efflux of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I).

We developed an IM-resistant GIST cell line (GIST-R) from the IM-sensitive GIST882 cell line (GIST-S) by growing these cells in IM. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that KIT is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance. Instead, GIST-R cells have acquired IM resistance by overexpressing the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase - AXL - in a 'kinase switch'. Further, the two IM resistant GIST patients express AXL and not c-Kit, seen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from Kit to AXL. In GIST-R, AXL is tyrosine phosphorylated and its ligand growth-arrest-specific gene 6 is overexpressed implying autocrine activation. The kinase switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain of mutant c-Kit (V654A) and AXL showed no binding to IM but efficient binding to MP470, a novel c-Kit/AXL kinase inhibitor.

Astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS).

This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin.

Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity.

The 65 kDa isoform, GAD65 is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas GAD67 is not. A hybrid cDNA was created by fusing a human cDNA for amino acids 1-101 of GAD67 to a human cDNA for amino acids 96-585 of GAD65; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have equivalent immunoreactivity to mammalian brain GAD with diabetes sera. We here report on enzymatic and molecular properties of rGAD67/65. METHODS: Studies were performed on enzymatic activity of rGAD67/65 by production of 3H-GABA from 3H-glutamate, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), stability according to differences in pH, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with various GAD-specific antisera.

In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1.

These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.",

Here we introduce novel compounds in which an olefinic functionality is incorporated into peptide analogues as the most potent turnover-dependent inactivators of PAM. Kinetic parameters for PAM inactivation by 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-phenyl-hex-2-enoic acid and 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid were obtained by using both the conventional dilution assay method and the more complex progress curve method. The results obtained from the progress curve method establish that these compounds exhibit the kinetic characteristics of pure competitive inactivators (i.e. no ESI complex forms during inactivation). On the basis of k(inact)/K(i) values, 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid is almost two orders of magnitude more potent than benzoylacrylate, a chemically analogous olefinic inactivator that lacks the peptide moiety. Stereochemical studies established that PAM inactivation by 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid is stereospecific with respect to the moiety at the P(2) position, which is consistent with previous results with substrates and reversible inhibitors. In contrast, 2, 4-dioxo-5-acetamido-6-phenylhexanoic acid, which is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ascorbate, exhibits a low degree of stereospecificity in binding to the ascorbate sites of both PAM and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.",

Numerous studies have suggested that increased TS levels are associated closely with resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. TAS-102 is a novel drug containing trifluorothymidine, which is phosphorylated by TK-1 to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit TS. TAS-102 has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer cells. TAS-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of TK-1 and TS in various types of cancer. TK-1 and TS expression was markedly different between cancer types. High TK-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high TS expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. These results led us to consider that TAS-102 may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases with high TS expression. In contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low TK-1 expression, may be resistant to TAS-102. In non-small cell lung cancers, high TK-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. This result suggests that TAS-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type.

There is no single ChE reactivator having an ability to reactivate sufficiently the inhibited enzyme due to the high variability of chemical structure of the inhibitors. The difficulties in reactivation of ChE activity and slight antidote effect regarding intoxication with some OPC are some of the reasons for continuous efforts to obtain new reactivators of ChE. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of some ChE reactivators against OPC intoxication (tabun, paraoxon and dichlorvos) in in vitro experiments and to compare their activity to that known for some currently used oximes (obidoxime, HI-6, 2-PAM). Experiments were carried out using rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Reactivators showed different activity in the reactivation of rat brain AChE after dichlorvos, paraoxon and tabun inhibition. AChE was easier reactivated after paraoxon treatment. The best effect showed BT-07-4M, obidoxime, TMB-4 and BT-08 from the group of symmetric oximes, and Toxidin, BT-05 and BT-03 from asymmetric compounds.

A variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Covalent binding studies were undertaken with [(14)C]-fenclozic acid to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. Time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. In human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. In addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a taurine conjugate of the drug was detected. Although an acyl glucuronide metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with UDPGA, there was no detectable UDPGA-dependent covalent binding. No effects were observed when fenclozic acid was assessed for P450-dependent and P450-independent cytotoxicity to THLE cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major human cytochrome P450 enzymes, inhibition of the biliary efflux transporters BSEP and MRP2 or mitochondrial toxicity to THLE or HepG2 cells.

We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 \u03bcM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation.

Although calorie restriction and weight loss increase insulin sensitivity, the effects of modifying macronutrient composition on insulin sensitivity are uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects on insulin sensitivity of a carbohydrate-rich diet (CARB; similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), a protein-rich diet (PROT; protein predominantly from plant sources), and an unsaturated fat-rich diet (UNSAT; predominantly monounsaturated). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a randomized, controlled, three-period, crossover feeding study. The study participants were 164 individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without diabetes. Diets were administered for 6 weeks each, with a washout period between diets of 2-4 weeks. Weight was held constant throughout the study. For our primary outcome, we calculated the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) using the end-of-period fasting serum glucose and insulin. QUICKI is a validated measure of insulin sensitivity. The primary analyses used generalized estimating equations. RESULTS At baseline, mean (SD) BMI was 30.2 (6.1) kg/m(2), and mean (SD) QUICKI was 0.35 (0.04). The UNSAT diet increased QUICKI by 0.005, more than the CARB diet (P = 0.04). PROT had no significant effect compared with CARB. CONCLUSIONS A diet that partially replaces carbohydrate with unsaturated fat may improve insulin sensitivity in a population at risk for cardiovascular disease. Given the well-recognized challenges of sustaining weight loss, our results suggest an alternative approach for improving insulin sensitivity.",

The present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable analogues of prostacyclin, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit tissue factor expression by human monocytic cells. Exposure of monocytic tumor THP-1 cells to 100 ng/ml endotoxin, 2 units/ml interleukin-1 beta, or 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 4 hours led to increased tissue factor procoagulant activity. Preincubation for 30 minutes with iloprost, ciprostene, and carbacyclin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tissue factor expression induced by all three challenging agents. Iloprost was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nM, a concentration close to the reported dissociation constant for iloprost binding to the platelet prostacyclin receptor. An orally active analogue, cicaprost, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced tissue factor expression. Carbacyclin and ciprostene were 100 times less potent. Iloprost prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of tissue factor antigen on the surface of THP-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry. Iloprost (500 pM-50 nM) increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. This effect was potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The inhibitory effects of iloprost on tissue factor expression were also potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine and mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP but not dibutyryl cyclic GMP.

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1.

Furthermore, mGlu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple mGlu5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mGlu5, termed the MPEP (2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. However, one mGlu5 PAM, CPPHA (N-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mGlu5.

NCFP binds to the CPPHA site on mGlu5 and potentiates mGlu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, NCFP provides greater mGlu5 subtype selectivity than does CPPHA, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mGlu5 in CNS preparations. Of interest, NCFP does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized MPEP site PAMs. This suggests that although mGlu5 PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mGlu5-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS.

The reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of monodemethylated CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 was confirmed in vivo by the thymus involution assay in adrenalectomized male rats. The aromatic A-ring derivatives-stimulated transcription of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in MCF-7 and T47D-CO human breast cancer cells but were much less potent than estradiol. Taken together, these data suggest that the proximal metabolites of mifepristone, CDB-2914, and CDB-4124 contribute significantly to the antiprogestational activity of the parent compounds in vivo. Furthermore, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 compared to mifepristone in vivo may be due in part to decreased activity of their putative proximal metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Sulindac independently modulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways.\nColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Substantial human and animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon tumors and prevent new tumor formation. The mechanism by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems complex as sulindac can modulate several growth-related signaling pathways. Sulindac metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular cyclic GMP and subsequently activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG); (b) activate c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); (c) inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2); and (d) decrease beta-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if PKG, ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin are independent targets for sulindac in vitro. Pharmacologic activation of PKG with YC-1 increases JNK phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation or beta-catenin protein expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 induces apoptosis but fails to activate JNK phosphorylation or down-regulate beta-catenin protein expression. Cotreatment with U0126 and YC-1 synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of sulindac treatment on ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin. These results indicate that sulindac metabolites modulate ERK1/2 and PKG pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of sulindac is mediated by more than one pathway. Using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Such therapies could dramatically reduce the incidence and death rate from colorectal cancer.",

METHODS: 12 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. They received carvedilol at daily doses of 1-20 mg with a 1-2 weekly adjustment. Serum carvedilol trough concentrations were measured in steady-state using a specific fluorescence HPLC method. The degree of improvement in heart failure was assessed from the ratio of change in the plasma BNP concentration, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the commencement of carvedilol administration. RESULTS: From the pharmacokinetic aspect, there was no valid correlation between the trough serum carvedilol concentration (Cmin) and daily dose per body weight (Dd/BW), indicating that there was a wide difference in the carvedilol elimination capacity among individuals. A significant decrease in the BNP was observed at the 3rd month in patients treated with the high dose (> 750 mg/3 months). On the other hand, in patients with a mean serum carvedilol level (Cmin) of less than 2.5 nmol/l up to 2 weeks after the start ofcarvedilol therapy, the degree of reduction in the BNP value after the 3rd month was significantly larger, relative to the patient group with Cmin over 2.5 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The total carvedilol dose was confirmed to be one of the determinants for improvement in heart failure, and it was suggested that the initial serum level also plays an important role in therapeutic outcome. Therefore, it may be important to monitor the serum carvedilol level at the introductory period to determine the daily dose requirements because of the wide inter-individual variability in its metabolic clearance.",

We now show that heregulin (HRG), but not EGF, stimulates p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, phospho-p95ErbB2 forms heterodimers with ErbB3, but not EGFR, while p185ErbB2 heterodimerizes with both EGFR and ErbB3. The predilection of p95ErbB2 to heterodimerize with ErbB3 provides an explanation for its regulation by HRG, an ErbB3 ligand. GW572016, a reversible small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, inhibits baseline p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 cells and tumor xenografts. Inhibition of p95ErbB2, p185ErbB2, and EGFR phosphorylation by GW572016 resulted in the inhibition of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, and cyclin D steady-state protein levels. Increased phosphorylation of p95ErbB2 and AKT in response to HRG was abrogated to varying degrees by GW572016. In contrast, trastuzumab did not inhibit p95ErbB2 phosphorylation or the expression of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, or cyclin D. It is tempting to speculate that trastuzumab resistance may be mediated in part by the selection of p95ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells capable of exerting potent growth and prosurvival signals through p95ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers. Thus, p95ErbB2 represents a target for therapeutic intervention, and one that is sensitive to GW572016 therapy.",

The mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (IKr, IKs, and IK1).

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity.

In addition, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a specific HO-1 inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of 5HHMF on LPS-induced NO production. Further, 5HHMF increased specific DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, and transient knockdown with Nrf2 siRNA subsequently reversed 5HHMF-induced NO inhibition, which was followed by suppression of HO-1 activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that 5HHMF suppresses NO production through modulation of iNOS, consequently suppressing NF-\u03baB activity and induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activity.",

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini.

Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

Experimental as well as clinical reports support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers such as verapamil may be an appropriate therapeutic approach in LQTS. We investigated the electrophysiologic mechanism by which verapamil suppresses TdP, in a recently developed intact heart model of LQT3. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, veratridine (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of sodium channel inactivation, led to a marked increase in QT-interval and simultaneously recorded monophasic ventricular action potentials (MAPs) (p < 0.05) thereby mimicking LQT3. In bradycardic (AV-blocked) hearts, simultaneous recording of up to eight epi- and endocardial MAPs demonstrated a significant increase in total dispersion of repolarization (56%, p < 0.05) and reverse frequency-dependence. After lowering potassium concentration, veratridine reproducibly led to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and TdP in 6 of 8 (75%) hearts. Additional infusion of verapamil (0.75 microM) suppressed EADs and consecutively TdP in all hearts. Verapamil significantly shortened endocardial but not epicardial MAPs which resulted in significant reduction of ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil is highly effective in preventing TdP via shortening of endocardial MAPs, reduction of left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of EADs in an intact heart model of LQT3. These data suggest a possible therapeutic role of verapamil in the treatment of LQT3 patients.",

In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.",

Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined mibefradil block of four Na+ channel isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells: Nav1.5 (cardiac), Nav1.4 (skeletal muscle), Nav1.2 (brain), and Nav1.7 (peripheral nerve). Mibefradil blocked Nav1.5 in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization. Mibefradil blocked currents of all Na+ channel isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mV and 0.007/s at -100 mV for Nav1.5). We further probed the interaction of mibefradil with inactivated Nav1.5 channels. Neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. In addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (Nav1.5 ICM + MTSET) did not alter mibefradil block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. We also tested whether mibefradil interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). When selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mV, mibefradil (1 microM) produced 45% fractional block in Nav1.5 and greater block (88%) in an isoform (Nav1.4) that slow-inactivates more completely. Our results suggest that mibefradil blocks Na+ channels in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).",

METHODS: Ethanol was given in drinking water at the concentration of 6 % (v/v), for one month. Changes in the levels of CREB and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein in the nucleus accumbens were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: Ethanol given to rats in drinking water decreased the level of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (-75 %) at the time of exposure to ethanol. The decrement of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens remained at 24 h (-35 %) and 72 h (-28 %) of ethanol withdrawal, which recovered toward control level after 7 d of ethanol withdrawal. However, chronic ethanol, as well as ethanol withdrawal failed to produce any significant alteration in the level of CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. Naloxone (alone) treatment of rats had no effect on the levels of CREB and p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. However, when naloxone was administered concurrently with ethanol treatment, it antagonized the down-regulation of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (142 %) of rats exposed to ethanol. CONCLUSION: A long-term intake of ethanol solution down-regulates the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens, and those changes can be reversed by naloxone, which may be one kind of the molecular mechanisms associated with ethanol dependence.",

With molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3H]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.",

BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells.

Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

After loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received LVP (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received oCRH (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma ACTH levels.

These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. Thus, we found that 5HHMF enhances heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. In addition, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a specific HO-1 inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of 5HHMF on LPS-induced NO production. Further, 5HHMF increased specific DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, and transient knockdown with Nrf2 siRNA subsequently reversed 5HHMF-induced NO inhibition, which was followed by suppression of HO-1 activity.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: DRF 2655 was studied in different genetic, normal, and hyperlipidemic animal models. HEK 293 cells were used to conduct the reporter-based transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. To understand the biochemical mechanism of lipid-, body-weight-, and glucose-lowering effects, activities of key beta-oxidation and lipid catabolism enzymes and gluconeogenic enzymes were studied in db/db mice treated with DRF 2655. 3T3L1 cells were used for adipogenesis study, and HepG2 cells were used to study the effect of DRF 2655 on total cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis using [(14)C]acetate and [(3)H]glycerol. RESULTS: DRF 2655 showed concentration-dependent transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma.

In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content.

Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b1 gene.

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

Cells were treated with pemetrexed and gemcitabine, and their interaction was assessed using the combination index. The role of drug metabolism in gemcitabine cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 5'-nucleotidase, and cytidine deaminase, whereas the role of pemetrexed targets, thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) in drug chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies. The effect of gemcitabine and pemetrexed on Akt phosphorylation was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study target gene-expression profiles and its modulation by each drug. Synergistic cytotoxicity was demonstrated, and pemetrexed significantly decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the expression of dCK in A549 and Calu-6 cells, as well as the expression of the human nucleoside equilibrative transporter 1 (hENT1) in all cell lines. PCR demonstrated a correlation between dCK expression and gemcitabine sensitivity, whereas expression of TS, DHFR, and GARFT was predictive of pemetrexed chemosensitivity. These data demonstrated that 1) gemcitabine and pemetrexed synergistically interact against NSCLC cells through the suppression of Akt phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3) pemetrexed enhances dCK and hENT1 expression, thus suggesting the role of gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations.",

The present study examined the effect of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on VMAT2 activity by measuring adenosine triphosphate-dependent [(3)H]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles prepared from rat striatum. SSRIs, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, inhibited vesicular [(3)H]dopamine uptake in vitro. The rank order of potency was reserpine>>fluoxetine, paroxetine>fluvoxamine, methamphetamine>MDMA. Moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by reserpine, a typical VMAT2 inhibitor, was uncompetitive, decreasing maximum velocity and affinity for dopamine. Inhibition by fluoxetine was noncompetitive, only decreasing maximum velocity for dopamine. These results suggest that fluoxetine inhibited the activity of VMAT2 by a mechanism different from that of reserpine and did not directly interact with the active site of VMAT2.",

Flecainide (1-300 mM) caused tonic and use-dependent block (UDB) of I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner.

The IC(50) value of peak and late I(Na) for WT was 127 +/- 6 and 44 +/- 2 microM (n = 20) and for DeltaKPQ was 80 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 2 microM (n = 31) respectively.

Recovery from block was slower for DeltaKPQ than for WT. We conclude that DeltaKPQ interacts differently with flecainide than with WT, leading to increased block and slowed recovery, especially for late I(Na).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of alpha1ARs, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors. RESULTS: Further characterization of the alpha1AR gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and alpha1aARs are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high alpha1aAR selectivity have attracted attention. Tamsulosin, which has high affinity for alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes but not for alpha1bAR, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents terazosin and doxazosin. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent alfuzosin also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the alpha1aAR subtype are under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Further advances in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH may depend not only on receptor subtype selectivity, but also on other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.",

Meta-analyses have demonstrated a 2-month increase in median survival after platinum-based therapy vs. best supportive care, and an absolute 10% improvement in the 1-year survival rate. Just as importantly, cytotoxic therapy has produced benefits in symptom control and quality of life. Newer agents, including the taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan, have expanded our therapeutic options in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite their contributions, we have reached a therapeutic plateau, with response rates seldom exceeding 30-40% in cooperative group studies and 1-year survival rates stable between 30% and 40%. It is doubtful that substituting one agent for another in various combinations will lead to any further improvement in these rates. The thrust of current research has focused on targeted therapy, and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition is one of the most promising clinical strategies. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors currently under investigation include the small molecules gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (IMC-225, Erbitux). Agents that have only begun to undergo clinical evaluation include CI-1033, an irreversible pan-erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and PKI166 and GW572016, both examples of dual kinase inhibitors (inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor and Her2).

However, serious clinical challenges persist. These include the identification of the optimal dose(s); the proper integration of these agents into popular, established cytotoxic regimens; and the selection of the optimal setting(s) in which to test these compounds.

METHODS: (+/-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007. R- and S-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure. RESULTS: (+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine.

Since the discovery of the functional role of PXR in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of PXR agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). However, more recently, it is clear that PXR is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances acetaminophen toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, in cancer therapeutics, PXR activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. Thus, in these instances, there may be a role for PXR antagonists. However, as opposed to the discovery efforts for PXR agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. The mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., sulforaphane) remains less clear. Our laboratory efforts have focused on this question.

In this study, uptake of phenformin and [(14)C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) and complex I inhibition by phenformin were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of phenformin was weaker in octn1(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice.

TAS-102 currently undergoing clinical trials, has been demonstrated to have at least two mechanisms, inhibition of TS and incorporation into DNA. We hypothesized that the thymidine metabolism enzyme may be a crucial factor that affects the antitumor activity of TAS-102. In the present study, we measured the enzyme activity of thymidine kinase (TK), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and thymidilate synthase (TS) in human cancer xenografts to investigate the contribution of these enzymes to the sensitivity of TAS-102. Antitumor activity of TAS-102 appears to be associated with TK, tumor growth and TS. However, the most related factors in this study were the TK and TP ratio. There was a significant correlation (p=0.04) between tumor growth inhibition and this ratio. These results suggested that the activation and degradation pattern of FTD plays an important role in the efficacy of TAS-102 and that it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict response to TAS-102 therapy. We also studied the influence of TPI on the capacity of exogenous dThd to reverse FTD-dependent growth inhibition. Thymidine (dThd) levels rescued the effect of FTD in vitro and significantly increased in serum after administration of TAS-102 or TPI alone but not FTD alone. This may suggest the possibility of a decrease in antitumor effect. However, our study indicated that the therapeutic index was clearly increased by FTD combined with TPI, compared with FTD alone, suggesting FTD-induced toxicity to sensitive host tissue can be selectively reversed with dThd. In conclusion, TK and TPI effects on TP play important roles in the cytotoxic action of TAS-102, and it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict more precisely individual resistance or sensitivity.",

However, a lot of patients with a phenotype resembling PHA1, show no defects in these proteins, making it likely that further genes are involved in the aetiology of this disease. Recent studies have elucidated additional participants (alpha-spectrin and members of the families of transmembrane serine proteases, ubiquitin-protein ligases, and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinases, respectively) regulating and/or interacting in the complex pathway of sodium retention in the amiloride-sensitive distal nephron. This led us to investigate whether PHA1 can also be associated with mutations in some of these genes. Our data suggest that at least the prostasin gene might be excluded as a causative locus.",

The current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of etomidate with alpha2-adrenoceptors in mice lacking individual alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2-KO). METHODS: Sedative and cardiovascular responses to etomidate and the alpha2-agonist, dexmedetomidine, were determined in mice deficient in alpha2-receptor subtypes. Inhibition of binding of the alpha2-receptor antagonist [3H]RX821002 to recombinant alpha2-receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of etomidate in wild-type and in alpha2A-receptor-deficient mice, indicating that the hypnotic effect of etomidate in mice does not require the alpha2A-receptor subtype. Intravenous injection of etomidate resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 +/- 0.2 min) in arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 +/- 3 mmHg). Etomidate did not affect blood pressure in alpha2B-KO or alpha2AB-KO mice. In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with alpha2-receptors, etomidate inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, [3H]RX821002, with higher potency from alpha2B- and alpha2C-receptors than from alpha2A-receptors (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm). In alpha2B-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, etomidate rapidly increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinases ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that etomidate acts as an agonist at alpha2-adrenoceptors, which appears in vivo primarily as an alpha2B-receptor-mediated increase in blood pressure. This effect of etomidate may contribute to the cardiovascular stability of patients after induction of anesthesia with etomidate.",

We propose a 3-D (three-dimensional) structural model for L-CPT I (liver CPT I), based on the similarity of this enzyme to the recently crystallized mouse carnitine acetyltransferase. The model includes 607 of the 773 amino acids of L-CPT I, and the positions of carnitine, CoA and the palmitoyl group were assigned by superposition and docking analysis. Functional analysis of this 3-D model included the mutagenesis of several amino acids in order to identify putative catalytic residues. Mutants D477A, D567A and E590D showed reduced L-CPT I activity. In addition, individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved Ser685-Thr686-Ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants T686A and S687A and altered K(m) and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine in mutant S685A. We conclude that the catalytic residues are His473 and Asp477, while Ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state.

Cocrystal structures of PDE5 catalytic (C) domain with inhibitors reveal a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-612, hydrogen bonds with Gln-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by Phe-820 and Val-782, and contacts with His-613, Leu-765, and Phe-786 [Sung et al.

A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors are equally activated by rilmenidine. Because alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in the brain and on cardiovascular sympathetic nerve terminals are identical, the latter were used as a model for the former to confirm or disprove this assumption. Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked [(3)H]norepinephrine release and of antagonists in counteracting the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition induced by moxonidine. In the rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the alpha(2)-autoreceptors, sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan. In contrast, prazosin is ineffective. In addition, a partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (a region known to substantially influence the pharmacological characteristics of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor) revealed marked differences between the rabbit and the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with alpha(2A)-autoreceptors, at which, however, both rilmenidine and oxymetazoline exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). The antagonistic property of rilmenidine at human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors but other, presumably I(1)-imidazoline receptors, are probably involved.",

However, exactly how tPA transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which tPA induces MMP-9 gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tPA were found to induce MMP-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of tPA are independent of its proteolytic activity. tPA bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the LRP-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking LRP-1, tPA failed to induce MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, tPA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the beta subunit of LRP-1, which was followed by the activation of Mek1 and its downstream Erk-1 and -2. Blockade of Erk-1/2 activation by the Mek1 inhibitor abolished MMP-9 induction by tPA in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated Mek1 induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, tPA, LRP-1, and MMP-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tPA acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.",

Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an EP1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, PGE1>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2. SC-51089 (10(-5) M), a selective EP1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor. The PGE1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) M). PGE1 and PGE2 also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that R-type Ca2+ channels are involved.

In this study, uptake of phenformin and [(14)C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) and complex I inhibition by phenformin were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the neurochemical effect of the SSRI citalopram on brain noradrenergic activity and the serotonin receptor involved in this effect. METHODS: Dual-probe microdialysis in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was performed in freely awake rats. RESULTS: Systemic citalopram (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) increased noradrenaline (NA) in the LC (E max\u2009=\u2009141\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0%) and simultaneously decreased NA in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-46\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0%). In the local presence into the LC of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist RS79948 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), systemic citalopram increased NA in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009157\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009175\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0%). Local citalopram (0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcM) into the LC induced NA increase in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and decrease in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-38\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0%).

CONCLUSIONS: The SSRI citalopram modulates central noradrenergic neurotransmission by activation, through endogenous serotonin, of 5-HT3 receptors expressed in the somatodendritic (LC) and terminal (PFC) areas, which subsequently promote an enhancement of local NA. Therefore, 5-HT3 receptors and somatodendritic \u03b12-adrenoceptors in the LC play an important role in the global effect of SSRIs.",

The effects of these metabolites on the expression of uteroglobin (UG) and progesterone receptor (PR) genes, both regulated by progesterone (P4), were evaluated in the uterus of prepubertal female rabbits that were simultaneously treated with P4 (1.0 mg) for 5 consecutive days. As determined by Western and Northern blot analyses, 5 alpha-NET inhibited the P4-induced UG gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. A similar inhibition was observed with the administration of RU-486. The estrogenic agent 3 beta,5 alpha-NET and estradiol at a dose of 1.0 mg also inhibited the UG gene expression induced by P4. Both 5 alpha-NET and 3 beta,5 alpha-NET blocked the PR down-regulation induced by P4 as assessed by Western and Northern blot methods. The inhibition of UG synthesis and PR down-regulation by 5 alpha-NET and 3 beta,5 alpha-NET indicates that these NET metabolites possess antiprogestational properties.",

The objective of the current study was to determine whether a low-dose subchronic DEX treatment (100 \u03bcg/kg for 8 consecutive days) exerts long-term effects on apoptosis in the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by examining the expression of cell death-promoting molecules (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p53, procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Bax) and cell-survival molecules (AKT, Bcl-2). Our results revealed that body, thymus and adrenal weight as well corticosterone level in the serum and PFC were reduced a day following last DEX injection. In PFC, DEX caused activation of AKT, augmentation of pro-survival Bcl-2 protein and enhanced Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, as well Bcl-2 translocation to mitochondria. The unaltered profile in the protein expression of apoptotic molecules PARP, procaspase 3 and Bax was detected, while the p53 protein was decreased. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed decrease of p53 mRNA level and no significant difference in Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expressions in DEX-treated rats. Finally, the DNA fragmentation assay and Fluoro-Jade staining demonstrated no considerable changes in the apoptosis in rat PFC. Our findings support the concept that a low-dose DEX creates the hypocorticoid state in the brain and indicate that subchronic DEX treatment activates pro-survival signalling pathway but does not change apoptotic markers in rat PFC. This mechanism might be relevant for DEX-induced apoptosis resistance observed during and after chemotherapy of patients with brain tumours. \u00a9 2013 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.",

The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.",

Aldosterone also induces the rapid phosphorylation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). PKD isoforms regulate protein trafficking, by the control of vesicle fission from the trans Golgi network (TGN) through activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseIII\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2).

The effect was counteracted by the D(2) antagonist eticlopride, pertussis toxin, the inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+) release TMB-8, incubation in Ca(2+)-free experimental medium, and PKC desensitization obtained by chronic pretreatment with the phorbol ester TPA. It was also antagonized by the non-specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin, and by the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, but not by the specific COX-1 inhibitor, valeryl salicylate.

Here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the Kcnk1 gene and characterized KCNK1 as a phenobarbital-inducible antihyperplasia factor. Upon activation by phenobarbital, nuclear receptor CAR binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the Kcnk1 promoter. This binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. Hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of Kcnk1 ( -/- ) male mice compared with those of Kcnk1 ( +/+ ) males after phenobarbital treatment. Thus, KCNK1 suppresses phenobarbital-induced hyperplasia. These results indicate that phenobarbital treatment induces KCNK1 to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal.

In liver, MAT2A expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K(m) of methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 (the MAT2A product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to S-adenosylmethionine inhibition. METHODS: Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced S-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine levels.",

The same doses of zuclopenthixol did not affect the ambulatory activity of rats in the openfield test and therefore the facilitatory effect of the drug on memory function could not be confounded with any motoric properties. This study also investigated the effect of zuclopenthixol on cortical and hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmitters' levels together with acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity, both of which are known to be important in control of cognitive function. Administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) neither affected dopamine (DA) level nor AChE activity in rat cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, the lower dose of zuclopenthixol elevated cortical norepinephrine (NE) level, while the higher dose elevated both cortical and hippocampal NE level together with hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) level. These results may suggest the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of zuclopenthixol on retrieval memory. Zuclopenthixol may therefore be a better alternative than other commonly used antipsychotic medications reported to impair cognitive function of schizophrenic patients.",

In this study, we evaluated wogonoside-induced autophagy on human breast MDA-MB-231 cells. We report that wogonoside triggered the formation of microtubule-associated protein-light chain 3 (MAP-LC3) positive autophagosomes and the accumulation of acidic vesicular and autolysosomes in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, cells treated by wogonoside developed autophagosome-like characteristics, including single and double membrane vacuoles containing intact and degraded cellular debris. The results showed that wogonoside promotes the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1. Furthermore, wogonoside inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was associated with wogonoside-induced autophagy. Wogonoside also suppressed the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70-S6 kinase (p70S6K) by regulating the expression of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 involved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors are equally activated by rilmenidine. Because alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in the brain and on cardiovascular sympathetic nerve terminals are identical, the latter were used as a model for the former to confirm or disprove this assumption. Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked [(3)H]norepinephrine release and of antagonists in counteracting the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition induced by moxonidine. In the rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the alpha(2)-autoreceptors, sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan. In contrast, prazosin is ineffective. In addition, a partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (a region known to substantially influence the pharmacological characteristics of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor) revealed marked differences between the rabbit and the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with alpha(2A)-autoreceptors, at which, however, both rilmenidine and oxymetazoline exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). The antagonistic property of rilmenidine at human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors but other, presumably I(1)-imidazoline receptors, are probably involved.",

Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. [-]-Huperzine A ([-]-Hup A), is a naturally occurring potent reversible AChE inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-Hup A for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-Hup A, is less toxic due to poor AChE inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-Hup A block the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of Hup A may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of [+]-Hup A with a small dose of [-]-Hup A ([+] and [-]-Hup A) against soman toxicity.

The data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of affinity for cGMP and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with Tyr-612, Gln-817, and Phe-820. Affinity of V782A for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or IBMX was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold, respectively.

Here, we identified Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak) as a molecular target of VK2-induced apoptosis. VK2 directly interacts with Bak and induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Although Bak and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), another member of the Bcl-2 family, are generally thought to be functionally redundant, only Bak is necessary and sufficient for VK2-induced cytochrome c (cyt c) release and cell death. Moreover, VK2-2,3 epoxide, an intracellular metabolite of VK2, was shown to covalently bind to the cysteine-166 residue of Bak. Several lines of evidence suggested that the covalent attachment of VK2 is critical for apoptosis induction. Thus this study reveals a specific role for Bak in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural, dimethylated analog of resveratrol with higher bioavailability. While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, PTE is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability.

Neither okadaic acid nor cantharidin (1-10000 nM) displaced [3H]naloxone from its specific binding sites, which indicates that they do not interact at the opioid receptor level.

Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination.

When tested in the intact cells, only 4 of 16 CGPs (at 10 \u03bcM) inhibited MRP1-mediated calcein efflux by >50% (III-1, V-3, -4, -6) while a fifth (I-5) inhibited efflux by just 23%. These five CGPs also inhibited [(3)H]E217\u03b2G uptake by MRP4. In contrast, their effects on MRP2 varied with two (V-4, V-6) inhibiting E217\u03b2G transport (IC50's 2.0, 9.2 \u03bcM), two (V-3, III-1) stimulating transport (>2-fold), while CGP I-5 had no effect. Strikingly, although V-3 and V-4 had opposite effects on MRP2 activity, they are structurally identical except for their chalcogen atom (Se versus Te). This study is the first to identify Class V CGPs with their distinctive methine or trimethine linkage between two disubstituted pyrylium moieties as a particularly potent class of MRP modulators and also show that within this core structure, differences in the electronegativity associated with a chalcogen atom can be the sole determinant of whether a compound will stimulate or inhibit MRP2.",

In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG) island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and expression.",

Several studies have suggested that cinobufagin has potent anti-cancer effects. The present study examines the apoptosis-inducing activity and the underlying mechanism of action of cinobufagin in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells. Among them, xIAP, cIAP-1, survivin and Bcl-2 levels decreased remarkably, while the levels of Bax and cleaved-PARP increased. Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3\u03b2 could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment. However, combined treatment with cinobufagin and SB216367 resulted in a significant reduction in p65 and an increase in cleaved-PARP in U2OS cells. Altogether, these results show that cinobufagin is a promising agent for the treatment of OS.

We wished to test whether these drugs also displayed high affinity for the related neuronal K(+) channel erg3. The cDNA encoding erg3 channel was cloned from a human brain library. Northern analysis confirmed that the channel was localized to brain relative to other tissues including heart, liver and lung. Within the brain, erg3 was expressed in higher amounts in the frontal lobe and cerebellum relative to the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Transient expression of erg3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced outwardly directed K(+) currents that activated at approximately -50 mV and produced a large transient component at positive membrane potentials. Inward tail currents measured at -100 mV were blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by sertindole resulting in an IC(50) value of 43 nM. Significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nM. Block of erg3 by sertindole also displayed a positive voltage-dependence.

The changes in cell morphology were observed using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cell apoptosis induced by DBDCT was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and characterized by cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins. DBDCT induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the generation of reactive oxygen species. DBDCT up-regulated the expression of Bax, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. DBDCT also caused the phosphorylation of JNK and p38(MAPK).

The clinical importance of such interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. The concomitantly administered effects of rifampicin on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes P450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, rifampicin can act on a pattern: rifampicin activates the nuclear pregnane X receptor that in turn affects cytochromes P450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the rifampicin inducing drug-drug interactions.

Its antipsychotic effect is assumed to be related to the active moiety, that is, the sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transport protein involved in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding CYP3A5 and P-gp (ABCB1) on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and the active moiety, taking CYP2D6 genotype status into account. Forty-six white patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone (1-10 mg/d) in monotherapy for 4-6 weeks were genotyped, and their plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured. Dose-corrected plasma concentrations (C/D) of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and active moiety showed up to 68-, 9-, and 10-fold interindividual variation, respectively. Six patients carried 1 CYP3A5*1 allele and therefore were likely to express the CYP3A5 enzyme. The CYP3A5 genotype did not influence risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, or active moiety C/Ds. The CYP2D6 genotype in these 46 patients was again associated with risperidone C/D (P = 0.001) but not with 9-hydroxyrisperidone C/D or active moiety C/D, as previously shown by our group in 37 of these patients. Patients homozygous for the ABCB1 3435T/2677T/1236T haplotype had significantly lower C/Ds of 9-hydroxyrisperidone (P = 0.026) and active moiety (P = 0.028) than patients carrying other ABCB1 genotypes.

However, the growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin was investigated in human colorectal HCT 116 cancer cells. Pinosylvin inhibited the proliferation of HCT 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase along with the downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, c-Myc, and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and the upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53.

Subsequently, pinosylvin suppressed the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, one of downstream molecules of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including BMP4, ID2, survivin, cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc.

Terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. Like other histamine H1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. Terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. Acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity.

High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum.

Astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). However, it is unclear if withdrawal from free-choice ethanol drinking causes changes in the numbers of astrocytes expressing GS or the cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Alcohol-preferring (P) rats exposed to free-choice ethanol drinking were either maintained without forced interruption of ethanol drinking, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period at the end of 2 months, or subjected to three 3-day withdrawal periods along 6 months. At 2 months, P rats were also compared with alcohol-naive alcohol non-preferring rats (NP) rats. Packing density of GS and GFAP-immunoreactive (IR) astrocytes was measured in sections from the prelimbic cortex (PLC) using the optical disector probe. An alcohol deprivation effect was observed in P rats with withdrawals during a 6-month ethanol drinking period. Ethanol withdrawal significantly increased the packing density of GS- and GFAP-IR astrocytes in the PLC of P rats as compared with P rats with continuous access to ethanol. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the pre-withdrawal ethanol consumption and the packing density of GS-IR astrocytes. The present results suggest the involvement of astrocytes in the regulation of the glutamatergic activation associated with withdrawal from free-choice ethanol consumption and point to differential adaptations of GS and GFAP to prolonged alcohol drinking in the PLC of P rats.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral quinidine in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of quinidine on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, quinidine restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant HERG genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of quinidine. CONCLUSION: Oral quinidine is effective in suppressing the gain of function in IKr responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in HERG and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible.",

To address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic progestins are not only referable to action through the progesterone receptor but may also be mediated by other steroid receptors, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in aldosterone salt-treated rats on long-term administration of 17beta-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and drospirenone, a new progestogen exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. The complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized Wistar rats induced by chronic aldosterone infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of 17beta-estradiol in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. The beneficial role of 17beta-estradiol on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular osteopontin expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired NO-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In contrast, drospirenone was either neutral or additive to 17beta-estradiol in protecting against aldosterone salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. The current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation.

These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.",

The mutation responsible for the analogue resistance and L-proline accumulation was a single nuclear dominant mutation. By introducing the mutant-derived genomic library into a non-L-proline-utilizing strain, the mutant was found to carry an allele of the wild-type PRO1 gene encoding gamma-glutamyl kinase, which resulted in a single amino acid replacement; Asp (GAC) at position 154 was replaced by Asn (AAC). Interestingly, the allele of PRO1 was shown to enhance the activities of gamma-glutamyl kinase and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, both of which catalyze the first two steps of L-proline synthesis from L-glutamate and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, yeast cells expressing the mutated gamma-glutamyl kinase were found to accumulate intracellular L-proline and showed a prominent increase in cell viability after freezing at -20 degrees C compared to the viability of cells harboring the wild-type PRO1 gene. These results suggest that the altered gamma-glutamyl kinase results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase activity, which leads to an increase in L-proline production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

However, its selectivity for the various K(ATP) channels is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide. Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that mitiglinide inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM). Nateglinide inhibits Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM, and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations (1 microM).

The insulin responses to glucose, mitiglinide, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide, nateglinide, or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment.

Furthermore, mGlu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple mGlu5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mGlu5, termed the MPEP (2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. However, one mGlu5 PAM, CPPHA (N-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mGlu5.

NCFP binds to the CPPHA site on mGlu5 and potentiates mGlu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, NCFP provides greater mGlu5 subtype selectivity than does CPPHA, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mGlu5 in CNS preparations. Of interest, NCFP does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized MPEP site PAMs. This suggests that although mGlu5 PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mGlu5-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS. Such stimulus bias by mGlu5 PAMs may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.",

There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action.

As part of an effort to discover orally active reversible inhibitors of MetAP2, a series of anthranilic acid sulfonamides with micromolar affinities for human MetAP2 were identified using affinity selection by mass spectrometry (ASMS) screening. These micromolar hits were rapidly improved to nanomolar leads on the basis of insights from protein crystallography; however, the compounds displayed extensive binding to human serum albumin and had limited activity in cellular assays. Modifications based on structural information on the binding of lead compounds to both MetAP2 and domain III of albumin allowed the identification of compounds with significant improvements in both parameters, which showed good cellular activity in both proliferation and methionine processing assays.",

The R-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: (+/-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007. R- and S-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure. RESULTS: (+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. Future trials with R-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.",

We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 \u03bcM tolbutamide and 20 \u03bcM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 \u03bcM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 \u03bcM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations \u22652 \u03bcM in INS-1 cells. Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 \u03bcM but not 1 \u03bcM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 \u03bcM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 \u03bcM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 \u03bcM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 \u03bcM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.",

    "abstract": "Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease.\nBACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR \"SDZ ENA 713\" . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. Use of rivastigmine in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. High-dose rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. At lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose rivastigmine than among those taking placebo. There was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of rivastigmine. The 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of rivastigmine transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. The efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. The efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. There appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both.

If left untreated, it may cause ischemic necrosis and colonic perforation, with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. Neostigmine enhances excitatory parasympathetic activity by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission and enhancing cholinergic action. We hypothesized that neostigmine would restore peristalsis in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at Fletcher Allen Health Care and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were treated for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with neostigmine 2.5 mg IV over 3 minutes while being monitored with telemetry. Mechanical obstruction had been excluded. RESULTS: Complete clinical resolution of large bowel distention occurred in 26 of the 28 patients. Time to pass flatus varied from 30 seconds to 10 minutes after administration of neostigmine. No adverse effects or complications were noted. Of the two patients who did not resolve, one had a sigmoid cancer that required resection and one patient died from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is the result of excessive parasympathetic suppression rather than sympathetic overactivity. We have shown that neostigmine is a safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.",

In vitro studies with blood-derived T cells, however, show inhibition of all three cytokines by GCS. We studied the effects of GCS on T cells from BAL in vitro, namely Th0-, Th1, and Th2-like clones; and we compared BAL- with blood-derived clones. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma in all 20 clones tested. IFN-gamma production was inhibited significantly less than IL-4 and IL-5. DEX enhanced the ratio IFN-gamma/IL-4 (mean +/- SEM: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 M DEX, 55.0 +/- 27.5, P<0.005). Interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of GCS on IL-2 production and IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 1) In low IL-2 producers DEX blocked IL-2 production and decreased IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 2) In high IL-2 producers DEX inhibited IL-2 production partially and enhanced IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation. Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL2R alpha blocked the DEX-induced increase in proliferation. High levels of added IL-2 induced the second type of response. In conclusion, the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by T-cell clones (derived either from BAL or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by DEX than that of IFN-gamma, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moxifloxacin (MXF) and VP-16 on cellular topo II activity in drug-treated cells and evaluate the influence of MXF on the mode of action of VP-16, on proliferation and apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Decatenation assay, band depletion and Western blot analysis, cytotoxic assay (MTT), flow cytometric studies (cell cycle and survivin expression), apoptosis (DAPI-sulforhodamine staining and caspase 3 activity) and IL-8 and VEGF secretion were determined. MXF or VP-16 slightly affected cellular topo II activity in nuclear extracts derived from drug-treated cells while the combination enhanced inhibitory activity and the reduction in band depletion of topo II. VP-16 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and the appearance of the subG1 peak which was increased by the addition of MXF. Apoptosis studies (DAPI staining and caspase 3 activity) showed a marked increase in the presence of MXF and VP-16 compared to VP-16 alone. VP-16 induced the release of IL-8, and addition of MXF reduced enhanced release and the spontaneous release of VEGF from the cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that the enhancement in the reduction of topo II activity by the combined MXF/VP-16 treatments was probably due to the increase in the level of the DNA-enzyme cleavable complexes formed by both drugs.

It results from intronic expansion of GAA triplet repeats at the FXN locus. Homozygous expansions cause silencing of the FXN gene and subsequent decreased expression of the encoded mitochondrial frataxin. Detailed analyses in fibroblasts and neuronal tissues from FRDA patients have revealed profound cytoskeleton anomalies. So far, however, the molecular mechanism underlying these cytoskeleton defects remains unknown. We show here that gene silencing spreads in cis over the PIP5K1B gene in cells from FRDA patients (circulating lymphocytes and primary fibroblasts), correlating with expanded GAA repeat size. PIP5K1B encodes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase \u03b2 type I (pip5k1\u03b2), an enzyme functionally linked to actin cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Accordingly, loss of pip5k1\u03b2 function in FRDA cells was accompanied by decreased PI(4,5)P2 levels and was shown instrumental for destabilization of the actin network and delayed cell spreading. Knockdown of PIP5K1B in control fibroblasts using shRNA reproduced abnormal actin cytoskeleton remodeling, whereas over-expression of PIP5K1B, but not FXN, suppressed this phenotype in FRDA cells. In addition to provide new insights into the consequences of the FXN gene expansion, these findings raise the question whether PIP5K1B silencing may contribute to the variable manifestation of this complex disease.",

Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3. It is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.",

The data showed that 4.8% (959) of lncRNA and 6.1% (1849) of protein coding gene were significantly differentially expressed. The differential expressions of lncRNA and protein coding genes had distinguishable hierarchical clustering expression profiling pattern. Among these differentially expressed lncRNAs, the greatest change was noted for uc002mbe.2, which had more than 300 folds induction upon TSA treatment.

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural, dimethylated analog of resveratrol with higher bioavailability. While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, PTE is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a novel mechanism of action for PTE during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.",

Cocrystal structures of PDE5 catalytic (C) domain with inhibitors reveal a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-612, hydrogen bonds with Gln-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by Phe-820 and Val-782, and contacts with His-613, Leu-765, and Phe-786 [Sung et al.

Present results of point mutations of full-length PDE5 showed that maximum catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in H613A and 55-fold in F820A. Catalytic-site affinities for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were respectively weakened 14-, 123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for Y612A; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for Q817A; and 59-, 448-, 71-, 137-, and 93-fold for F820A. The data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of affinity for cGMP and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with Tyr-612, Gln-817, and Phe-820. Affinity of V782A for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or IBMX was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold, respectively. Change in affinity for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX in Y612F, H613A, L765A, or F786A was less, but affinity of H613A or F786A for tadalafil was weakened 37- and 17-fold, respectively. The results quantify the role of PDE5 catalytic-site residues for cGMP and inhibitors, indicate that Tyr-612, Gln-817, and Phe-820 are the most important cGMP or inhibitor contacts studied, and identify residues that contribute to selectivity among different classes of inhibitors.",

It is reportedly taken up by hepatocytes and exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in the liver. In this study, uptake of phenformin and [(14)C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) and complex I inhibition by phenformin were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of phenformin was weaker in octn1(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that uptake of phenformin into liver mitochondria is at least partly mediated by OCTN1 and functionally relevant to its inhibition potential of complex I respiration. This study was, thus, the first to demonstrate OCTN1-mediated mitochondrial transport and toxicity of biguanide in vivo in rodents.",

However, salicylate moiety appears to interfere with aspirin inhibitory action on platelets and vascular COX. Such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of ASA-induced asthma. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT, trilisate) pre-treatment on ASA-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. Pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, PNIF and serum salicylate levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of ASA. Trilisate administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a moderate protection against ASA-induced symptoms; it diminished the severity and/or delayed the appearance of FEV1 fall. Maximal decreases in FEV1 as well as reaction intensity indexes were significantly lower (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002, respectively) after trilisate pre-treatment as compared to placebo. Trilisate also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients. Although the precise mechanism of the protective action of trilisate is unknown, our data support the possibility of interaction between salicylate and ASA on cyclo-oxygenase locus in the respiratory tract in ASA-intolerant patients.",

Our recent study has demonstrated that coadministration of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor harmaline (5 mg/kg) increases systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 mg/kg) and active metabolite bufotenine. This study is aimed at delineating harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions at multiple dose levels, as well as the impact of CYP2D6 that affects harmaline PK and determines 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce bufotenine. Our data revealed that inhibition of MAO-A-mediated metabolic elimination by harmaline (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg) led to a sharp increase in systemic and cerebral exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 and 10 mg/kg) at all dose combinations. A more pronounced effect on 5-MeO-DMT PK was associated with greater exposure to harmaline in wild-type mice than CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice. Harmaline (5 mg/kg) also increased blood and brain bufotenine concentrations that were generally higher in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. Surprisingly, greater harmaline dose (15 mg/kg) reduced bufotenine levels. The in vivo inhibitory effect of harmaline on CYP2D6-catalyzed bufotenine formation was confirmed by in vitro study using purified CYP2D6. Given these findings, a unified PK model including the inhibition of MAO-A- and CYP2D6-catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT metabolism by harmaline was developed to describe blood harmaline, 5-MeO-DMT, and bufotenine PK profiles in both wild-type and Tg-CYP2D6 mouse models. This PK model may be further employed to predict harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT PK interactions at various doses, define the impact of CYP2D6 status, and drive harmaline-5-MeO-DMT pharmacodynamics.",

The concomitantly administered effects of rifampicin on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes P450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, rifampicin can act on a pattern: rifampicin activates the nuclear pregnane X receptor that in turn affects cytochromes P450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the rifampicin inducing drug-drug interactions.

There is no single ChE reactivator having an ability to reactivate sufficiently the inhibited enzyme due to the high variability of chemical structure of the inhibitors. The difficulties in reactivation of ChE activity and slight antidote effect regarding intoxication with some OPC are some of the reasons for continuous efforts to obtain new reactivators of ChE. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of some ChE reactivators against OPC intoxication (tabun, paraoxon and dichlorvos) in in vitro experiments and to compare their activity to that known for some currently used oximes (obidoxime, HI-6, 2-PAM). Experiments were carried out using rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Reactivators showed different activity in the reactivation of rat brain AChE after dichlorvos, paraoxon and tabun inhibition. AChE was easier reactivated after paraoxon treatment. The best effect showed BT-07-4M, obidoxime, TMB-4 and BT-08 from the group of symmetric oximes, and Toxidin, BT-05 and BT-03 from asymmetric compounds. The reactivation of brain AChE inhibited with tabun demonstrated better activity of new compound BT-07-4M, TMB-4 and obidoxime from symmetric oximes, and BT-05 and BT-03 possessing asymmetric structure.

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3H]idazoxan (IDX) binding vs. [125I]p-iodoclonidine (PIC) binding. Nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3H] IDX were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3H]IDX-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). Furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125I]PIC. Affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125I]PIC binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > IDX > amiloride). However, the minor component of [125I]PIC binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3H]IDX, was consistent with a subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > IDX >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2A adrenoceptor.

However, its selectivity for the various K(ATP) channels is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide.

Nateglinide inhibits Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM, and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations (1 microM). Binding experiments on mitiglinide, nateglinide, and repaglinide to SUR1 expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of [3H]glibenclamide to SUR1 (IC50 values: mitiglinide, 280 nM; nateglinide, 8 microM; repaglinide, 1.6 microM), suggesting that they all share a glibenclamide binding site. The insulin responses to glucose, mitiglinide, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide, nateglinide, or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment.

The amines bind to the enzyme by a direct coordination to the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) at the active site (charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. Experimental evidence is presented that a group with an apparent pKa value of about 5.1 (20 degrees C) is involved in the interaction between the catecholamine and the enzyme. The high-affinity binding of L-noradrenaline to phenylalanine hydroxylase, as studied by equilibrium microdialysis (anaerobically) and ultrafiltration (aerobically), shows positive cooperativity (h = 1.9); at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C the rat enzyme binds about 0.5 mol L-noradrenaline/mol subunit with a half-maximal binding (S50) at 0.25 microM L-noradrenaline. No binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed. The affinity decreases with decreasing pH, by phosphorylation and by preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate L-phenylalanine, while it increases after alkylation of the enzyme with the activator N-ethylmaleimide. Preincubation of the enzyme with L-phenylalanine also leads to a complete loss of the cooperativity of L-noradrenaline binding (h = 1.0). The many similarities in binding properties of the inhibitor L-noradrenaline and the activator/substrate L-phenylalanine makes it likely that the cooperative interactions of these effectors are due to their binding to the same site. The high-affinity of catecholamines to phenylalanine hydroxylase is a valuable probe to study the active site of this enzyme and is also relevant for the homologous enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is purified as a stable catecholamine-Fe(III) complex.",

Conversely, the ratio of fatty acid to glycerol released into the medium decreased. Regulation of cAspAT gene expression was specific to differentiated adipocytes and did not require any peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)/retinoid X receptor-alpha direct binding. Nevertheless, PPARgamma is indirectly necessary for both cAspAT basal expression and TZD responsiveness because they are, respectively, diminished and abolished by ectopic overexpression of a dominant negative PPARgamma. The cAspAT TZD-responsive site was restricted to a single AGGACA hexanucleotide located at -381 to -376 bp whose mutation impaired the specific RORalpha binding. RORalpha ectopic expression activated the cAspAT gene transcription in absence of rosiglitazone, and its protein amount in nuclear extracts is 1.8-fold increased by rosiglitazone treatment of adipocytes. Finally, the amounts of RORalpha and cAspAT mRNAs were similarly increased by TZD treatment of human adipose tissue explants, confirming coordinated regulation. Our data identify cAspAT as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by TZD via the control of RORalpha expression by PPARgamma in adipocytes.",

For comparison, the effects of D-1997 were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT receptor agonist quipazine. Thus, 4-HT (10(-10)-10(-6)M), D-1997 (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and quipazine (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of 5-HT > D-1997 > quipazine. 5-HT and D-1997 exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of quipazine. Similar concentrations of D-1997 failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.01-1 microM), the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist ICS205930 (tropisetron; 0.1-10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine (0.01-1 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites (+/-)-pindolol (0.01-1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the D-1997-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that D-1997 contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors unrelated to either the 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes.

In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of LTD4 (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases accompanied with increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). LTD4 also induced expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) and NF-\u03baB p65 in the hippocampus and cortex.

Moreover, LTD4-induced increases in CysLT(1)R and NF-\u03baB p65 in the brain were also attenuated by pranlukast.

METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.",

However, the mechanisms underlying hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion are not fully understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of alpha-tocopherol re-efflux from hepatocytes, the cells that have the most important role in regulating plasma-alpha-tocopherol concentrations. From in vitro experiments using [(3)H]alpha-tocopheryl acetate and McARH7777 cells that stably express alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP), the following results were obtained. First, addition of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a direct acceptor of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-secreted lipids, increased alpha-tocopherol secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Second, probucol, an antiatherogenic compound reported to be an inactivator of ABCA1 reduced hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion. Third, ABCA1-RNAi suppressed hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion. In a mouse in vivo experiment, addition of 1% probucol to the diet decreased plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations.

However, the relative contribution from each enzyme remains controversial. The CYP2B6*6 allele is associated with reduced enzyme expression and activity that may lead to interindividual variability in ketamine metabolism. We examined the N-demethylation of individual ketamine enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele, insect cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 protein variant. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitors on norketamine formation were also determined in HLMs. The two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model best fitted the HLM kinetic data. The Km value for the high affinity enzyme and the low affinity enzyme were similar to those for the expressed CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, respectively. The intrinsic clearance for both ketamine enantiomers by the high affinity enzyme in HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype were at least 2-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for CYP2B6*1/*6 genotype and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype.

We assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived SPM in adipose tissue and effects of dietary EPA/DHA thereon.Moreover, we treated obese mice with SPM precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Obesity significantly decreased DHA-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA, resolvin D1 precursor) and protectin D1 levels in murine adipose tissue. Dietary EPA/DHA treatment restored endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 derived lipid mediators in obesity while attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity. Notably, 17-HDHA treatment reduced adipose tissue expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased adiponectin expression and improved glucose tolerance parallel to insulin sensitivity in obese mice.

Previous studies established that stimulation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells activates Rac1 and enhances motility via the Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1. As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that ErbB-driven Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the Jak2 pathway.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription.

However, whether increasing EETs production by CYP2J2 overexpression in vivo could prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unknown. Here we investigated the effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression on angiotensin (Ang) II-induced AAA in apoE-deficient mice. rAAV-CYP2J2 delivery led to an abundant aortic CYP2J2 expression and increased EETs generation. It was shown that CYP2J2 overexpression attenuated matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity, elastin degradation, and AAA formation, which was associated with reduced aortic inflammation and macrophage infiltration. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression and EETs markedly suppressed Ang II-induced inflammatory cytokine expression. Moreover, overexpressed CYP2J2 and EETs inhibited Ang II-induced macrophage migration in a VSMC-macrophage coculture system. We further indicated that these protective effects were mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression prevents AAA development which is likely via PPAR\u03b3 activation and anti-inflammatory action, suggesting that increasing EETs levels could be considered as a potential strategy to prevent and treat AAA.",

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

While 5-HT(4) agonists are used as prokinetic agents, the physiological role of 5-HT(4) receptors in the human gut is unknown. AIMS: Our aim was to characterise the role of 5-HT(4) receptors in regulating gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and stimulated conditions with a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist. METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist (SB-207266) on the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone (a 5-HT(4) mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. In part B, 52 healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg of SB-207266 for 10-12 days; gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy on days 7-9, and fasting and postprandial colonic motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on day 12. RESULTS: Part A: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of SB-207266 had significant and quantitatively similar effects, antagonising the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal transit. Part B: SB-207266 tended to delay colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)), but did not have dose related effects on transit, fasting or postprandial colonic motor activity, compliance, or sensation. CONCLUSION: 5-HT(4) receptors are involved in the regulation of cisapride stimulated orocaecal transit; SB 207266 tends to modulate colonic transit but not sensory functions or compliance in healthy human subjects.",

Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. The above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.",

First, in the presence of 1 mm ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was 30-100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and menadione) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected. In addition, ADP was shown to strongly antagonize TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Second, C427A mutant human TOP2alpha, which exhibits reduced ATPase activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance to all ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Third, using ciprofloxacin competition assay, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by ciprofloxacin.

The cAMP phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively. The oxidized and t-butyl analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the basal (Ca2+/calmodulin-independent) activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase as well as the calmodulin-stimulated activity. Calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. These observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (IC50 = 17.4 microM), whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kD light chain (IC50 = 12.6 microM) or intact myosin (IC50 = 11.0 microM) was used as substrate. Inhibition in each case was prevented by excess calmodulin. The oxidized and t-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition. Finally, the effects of felodipine and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin and the assembly of myosin filaments. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin (IC50 = 25.1 microM). The oxidized and t-butyl analogues exhibited no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not. Again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase and myosin filament assembly by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. These observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of felodipine on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.",

The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.",

Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak.

Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner.

In vitro studies with blood-derived T cells, however, show inhibition of all three cytokines by GCS. We studied the effects of GCS on T cells from BAL in vitro, namely Th0-, Th1, and Th2-like clones; and we compared BAL- with blood-derived clones. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma in all 20 clones tested. IFN-gamma production was inhibited significantly less than IL-4 and IL-5. DEX enhanced the ratio IFN-gamma/IL-4 (mean +/- SEM: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 M DEX, 55.0 +/- 27.5, P<0.005). Interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of GCS on IL-2 production and IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 1) In low IL-2 producers DEX blocked IL-2 production and decreased IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 2) In high IL-2 producers DEX inhibited IL-2 production partially and enhanced IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation. Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL2R alpha blocked the DEX-induced increase in proliferation. High levels of added IL-2 induced the second type of response. In conclusion, the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by T-cell clones (derived either from BAL or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by DEX than that of IFN-gamma, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma.

The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the above mentioned allergic parameters. METHODS: Rats were sensitized and provocated by TDI and the nasal allergy-like behaviors were scored during a 10 minute period after provocation. Histamine content and HDC activity in the nasal mucosa were determined using fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of HDC mRNA in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Prodrugs 2 and 31 were also highly soluble at both acidic and neutral pH values. At a solution dose of 14.2mpk (equivalent to 10mpk of 1), 2 gave essentially the same exposure of 1 compared to dosing 10mpk of 1 itself. At a suspension dose of 142mpk (equivalent to 100mpk of 1), 2 demonstrated that it could overcome the solubility issue associated with 1 and provide a much higher exposure of 1. To our knowledge, the unique type of prodrugs like 2, 28, and 31 was not reported in the past and could represent a novel prodrug approach for secondary amides, a class of molecules frequently identified as drug candidates.",

Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.",

Numerous studies have suggested that increased TS levels are associated closely with resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. TAS-102 is a novel drug containing trifluorothymidine, which is phosphorylated by TK-1 to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit TS. TAS-102 has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer cells. TAS-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of TK-1 and TS in various types of cancer. TK-1 and TS expression was markedly different between cancer types. High TK-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high TS expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. These results led us to consider that TAS-102 may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases with high TS expression. In contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low TK-1 expression, may be resistant to TAS-102. In non-small cell lung cancers, high TK-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. This result suggests that TAS-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type. Our results indicate that administration of TAS-102 could be selected on the basis of the immunohistochemical evaluation of TK-1 and TS.",

In the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state GnRH-R mRNA levels in pituitaries of male rats from Day 5 to Day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. Developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (alpha, FSHbeta, and LHbeta) mRNA levels were also assessed. In addition, the role of the endogenous GnRH on the maturational changes of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression was investigated. Messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from anterior pituitaries. Amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb) GnRH-R mRNA increased slowly from Day 5 through the infantile and the juvenile periods, to peak at Day 35 (12-fold increase vs. Day 5). Thereafter, the levels of the GnRH-R mRNA decline slightly until Day 55 (33% decrease vs. Day 35). Parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the GnRH-R gene. Alpha subunit mRNA was easily detected at Day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at Day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. Day 5) with a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until Day 35; then it decreased by 41.5% at Day 55. FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA levels rose slowly until Day 25. A sharp rise occurred thereafter to reach maximum levels at Day 35 (5.8-fold for FSHbeta and 3.8-fold for LHbeta vs. Day 25). Thereafter, the levels of both mRNAs fell until Day 55 (44.1% decrease for FSHbeta and 37.1% decrease for LHbeta vs. Day 35). To ascertain whether developmental activation of the GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is GnRH dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous GnRH action by treating developing male rats with the specific GnRH antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/week, s.c.) through the infantile (Days 5-20) and the juvenile periods (Days 20-35). Cetrorelix completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of the GnRH-R mRNA, during both the infantile and the juvenile periods. Cetrorelix also abolished the developmental rise of the gonadotropin beta subunit mRNAs during the two periods of the study. In contrast, the alpha subunit gene expression was not altered by cetrorelix treatment during any of the two periods. These data demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted induction of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression. Developmental activation of GnRH-R and gonadotropin beta subunit genes is GnRH dependent. The apparent GnRH-independent regulation of the alpha-glycoprotein subunit mRNA levels may be due to the contribution of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.",

METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.",

Enzymes and binding proteins involved in retinoid metabolism are highly conserved across species. We previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of all-trans-retinol. Specifically, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol is transiently oxidized to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid before being oxidized further by Cyp26 enzymes. Here, we report the identification of two putative RetSat homologues in zebrafish, one of which, zebrafish RetSat A (zRetSat A), also had retinol saturase activity, whereas zebrafish RetSat B (zRetSat B) was inactive under similar conditions. Unlike mouse RetSat (mRetSat), zRetSat A had an altered bond specificity saturating either the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-retinol to produce either all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol, respectively. zRetSat A also saturated the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2), a second endogenous form of vitamin A in zebrafish. The dual enzymatic activity of zRetSat A displays a newly acquired specificity for the 13-14 double bond retained in higher vertebrates and also the evolutionarily preserved activity of bacterial phytoene desaturases and plant carotenoid isomerases. Expression of zRetSat A was restricted to the liver and intestine of hatchlings and adult zebrafish, whereas zRetSat B was expressed in the same tissues but at earlier developmental stages. Exogenous all-trans-retinol, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol led to the strong induction of the expression of the retinoic acid-metabolizing enzyme, Cyp26A1, arguing for an active signaling function of dihydroretinoid metabolites in zebrafish. These findings point to a conserved function but altered specificity of RetSat in vertebrates, leading to the generation of various dihydroretinoid compounds, some of which could have signaling functions.",

Pharmacogenetic analysis of two genes, the warfarin metabolic enzyme CYP2C9 and warfarin target enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 VKORC1, confirmed their influence on warfarin maintenance dose. Possession of CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 variant alleles, which result in decreased enzyme activity, is associated with a significant decrease in the mean warfarin dose. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VKORC1 are associated with warfarin dose across the normal dose range. Haplotypes based on these SNPs explain a large fraction of the interindividual variation in warfarin dose, and VKORC1 has an approximately three-fold greater effect than CYP2C9.

BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells. Allopregnanolone was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50), approximately 10 muM), followed by BDZs (IC(50), approximately 50 muM), pentobarbital (IC(50), 0.3-1 mM), and ethanol (IC(50), approximately 300 mM). Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

The introduction of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence has been mainly based on behavioral animal models that provide evidence of the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in alcohol drinking and dependence. It has been well known that alcohol leads to the activation of the endogenous opioid system. The endogenous opioid agonists, such as beta-endorphin, increase the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system through the inhibition of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing inhibitory interneurons in the ventral tegmental area, resulting in the expression of alcohol reinforcement and/or rewarding effect.

In this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. To evaluate whether fisetin regulates mTORC1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and mTORC1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTORC1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of S6K1, mTOR and Akt in fisetin-treated TSC2-knockdown cells. The results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mTORC1 activity in an Akt-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mTORC1 activity. Fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mTOR. The inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mTOR activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mTORC1 signaling. Fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. We also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1 and mTORC1 in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and obesity in HFD-fed mice.

The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. Furthermore, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b1 gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene, which is mediated by C/EBP \u03b1 inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.",

Here, translocation studies using the human androgen receptor (hAR) and the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) were performed to aid in identifying the mechanism by which anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were activating hAR and potentially interacting with hGR and how glucocorticoid ligands were interacting with the hGR and hAR. The real-time analysis of EGFP-labeled hAR and hGR ligand-induced cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation was performed using fluorescence microscopy to better understand the action of these NHRs in a physiologically relevant cell-based model. After transient transfection, the hAR and hGR individually translocate as expected (i.e., transport is ligand-induced and dose-dependent) in this model biological system. Testosterone (TEST) had the fastest translocation rate for the hAR of 0.0525 min(-1). The other endogenous steroids, androstenedione (ANE) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), had considerably lower hAR transport rates. The rates of hAR transport for the exogenous steroids methyltrienelone (MET), nandrolone (NAN), and oxandrolone (OXA) are lower than that of testosterone and similar to those of the endogenous steroids ANE and DHT. The hGR transport rates for cortisol (COR) and dexamethasone (DEX) are also presented. The synthetic GC, DEX, had a more rapid translocation rate (0.1599 min(-1)) at the highest dose of 100 nM compared to the endogenous GC COR (0.0431 min(-1)). The data obtained agrees with the existing qualitative data and adds an important ligand-dependent kinetic component to hAR and hGR transport.

For comparison, the effects of D-1997 were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT receptor agonist quipazine. Thus, 4-HT (10(-10)-10(-6)M), D-1997 (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and quipazine (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of 5-HT > D-1997 > quipazine. 5-HT and D-1997 exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of quipazine. Similar concentrations of D-1997 failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.01-1 microM), the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist ICS205930 (tropisetron; 0.1-10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine (0.01-1 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites (+/-)-pindolol (0.01-1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the D-1997-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that D-1997 contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors unrelated to either the 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes.

Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GPR54-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of kisspeptin stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GPR54 mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GPR54 signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma luteinising hormone (LH) levels and significantly increases plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of kisspeptin results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence kisspeptin has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans. This review discusses the evidence highlighting kisspeptin's key role in human reproduction.",

The aim of our study was to provide new data on the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of phillyrin in the prevention of high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. We found that phillyrin suppressed high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Phillyrin strongly inhibited high glucose-induced fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression by modulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) activation. Moreover, use of the pharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C revealed that AMPK is essential for suppressing SREBP-1c expression in phillyrin-treated cells. Finally, we found that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation is required for the phillyrin-enhanced activation of AMPK in HepG2 hepatocytes. These results indicate that phillyrin prevents lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by blocking the expression of SREBP-1c and FAS through LKB1/AMPK activation, suggesting that phillyrin is a novel AMPK activator with a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM).

Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and DAT effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. Dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to DAT occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). DAT occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (FECNT). DAT occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular DA in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in DA and DAT occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with DAT effects determined with in vivo techniques.

The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D(2) occupancy (using [(11)C]raclopride) and 5-HT(2) occupancy (using [(18)F]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The mean 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean D(2) receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated with 50% maximal 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for D(2) receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater 5-HT(2) than D(2) receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of ziprasidone is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high D(2) receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.",

In addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of Ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the Ras/RAF pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits C-RAF kinase was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF (wild type and V600E mutant). It inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of sorafenib revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and Kit), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling).

Several new immunosuppressive agents and formulations are undergoing clinical investigation and are discussed in this review.A modified release tacrolimus formulation (MR4) for once-daily administration is undergoing phase III trials.

Although the efficacy of fingolimod is similar to MMF in patients receiving full doses of ciclosporin, safety issues such as a negative chronotropic effect, macular oedema, pulmonary adverse reactions and graft function resulted in premature discontinuation of the development programme for kidney transplantation.

We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K(i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT(EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA(EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA(EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE(EX) and DA(EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA(EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA(EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.",

Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3H]idazoxan (IDX) binding vs. [125I]p-iodoclonidine (PIC) binding. Nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3H] IDX were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3H]IDX-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). Furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125I]PIC. Affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125I]PIC binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > IDX > amiloride). However, the minor component of [125I]PIC binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3H]IDX, was consistent with a subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > IDX >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2A adrenoceptor. These nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to clonidine and endogenous clonidine-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of imidazoline receptors in humans.",

Eight male human subjects each received a single 50-mg oral dose of [(14)C]valdecoxib. Urine, feces, and blood samples were collected after administration of the radioactive dose. Most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated with valdecoxib and the hydroxylated metabolite of valdecoxib (M1). The estimated terminal half-life for valdecoxib was about 7 h. About 76.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces. Valdecoxib was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase I metabolites were identified. The primary oxidative metabolic pathways of valdecoxib involved hydroxylation at either the methyl group to form M1 or N-hydroxylation at the sulfonamide moiety to form M2. Further oxidation of M1 led to the formation of several other phase I metabolites. Oxidative breakdown of the N-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in M2 led to the formation of corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid metabolites. The O-glucuronide conjugate of M1 and N-glucuronide conjugate of valdecoxib were the major urinary metabolites, which accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total administered dose, respectively. The remaining urinary metabolites were glucuronide conjugates of other phase I metabolites. Only 3% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent, suggesting that renal clearance is insignificant for valdecoxib. Absorption of valdecoxib was excellent since the recovery of unchanged valdecoxib in feces was <1% of the administered dose.",

The genes and signaling pathways affected by TCDD that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD. Thus, the TCDD-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and Rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of TCDD-exposed UGS organ cultures with RSPO2 and/or RSPO3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of TCDD on canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.

First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Top2\u03b2 were shown to be hypersensitive to CPT with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, ICRF-187, a Top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete Top2\u03b2, specifically sensitized MEFs to CPT. To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the RNAP LS level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, RNAP LS depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis.

In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.",

We hypothesized that increased neutrophil recruitment by keratinocytes may contribute to the delayed healing of diabetic wound. Using cultured human keratinocytes and diabetic rat model, the current study showed that high-glucose environment enhanced IL-8 production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in keratinocytes. In addition, diabetic rat skin showed enhanced EGFR, ERK and IL-8 expression as compared to control rats. The dermal neutrophil infiltration of the wound, as represented by expression of myeloperoxidase level, was also significantly higher in diabetic rats. Treating diabetic rats with dapsone, an agent known to inhibit neutrophil function, was associated with improved healing. In conclusion, IL-8 production and neutrophil infiltration are increased in high-glucose environment due to elevated ROS level and contributed to impaired wound healing in diabetic skin.

We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E(2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood.

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1. In summary, reduction of DMAs(V) to the highly toxic DMAs(III) in rats and rat liver cytosol is a GSH-dependent enzymatic process, yet its mechanism remains uncertain.",

The data indicated that PhIP could cause stomach injury, oxidative stress in rat stomachs as well as the activation of c-fos and c-jun and inactivation of p16, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of PhIP-associated stomach cancer.",

Five classes of chalcogenopyrylium dyes (CGPs) were examined for their ability to modulate transport of [(3)H]estradiol glucuronide (E217\u03b2G) (a prototypical MRP substrate) into MRP-enriched inside-out membrane vesicles. Additionally, some CGPs were tested in intact transfected cells using a calcein efflux assay. Sixteen of 34 CGPs inhibited MRP1-mediated E217\u03b2G uptake by >50% (IC50's 0.7-7.6 \u03bcM). Of 9 CGPs with IC50's \u22642 \u03bcM, two belonged to Class I, two to Class III and five to Class V. When tested in the intact cells, only 4 of 16 CGPs (at 10 \u03bcM) inhibited MRP1-mediated calcein efflux by >50% (III-1, V-3, -4, -6) while a fifth (I-5) inhibited efflux by just 23%. These five CGPs also inhibited [(3)H]E217\u03b2G uptake by MRP4. In contrast, their effects on MRP2 varied with two (V-4, V-6) inhibiting E217\u03b2G transport (IC50's 2.0, 9.2 \u03bcM), two (V-3, III-1) stimulating transport (>2-fold), while CGP I-5 had no effect. Strikingly, although V-3 and V-4 had opposite effects on MRP2 activity, they are structurally identical except for their chalcogen atom (Se versus Te). This study is the first to identify Class V CGPs with their distinctive methine or trimethine linkage between two disubstituted pyrylium moieties as a particularly potent class of MRP modulators and also show that within this core structure, differences in the electronegativity associated with a chalcogen atom can be the sole determinant of whether a compound will stimulate or inhibit MRP2.",

In addition, alpha-lactalbumin (LA) enhances this Glc-T activity more than 25 times. Comparison of the crystal structures of UDP-Gal- and UDP-Glc-bound beta4Gal-T1 reveals that the O4 hydroxyl group in both Gal and Glc moieties forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317. The orientation of the O4 hydroxyl of glucose causes a steric hindrance to the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low Glc-T activity. In this study, we show that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to lysine (R228K-Gal-T1) results in a 15-fold higher Glc-T activity, which is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the Gal-T activity of the wild type. The kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of Arg228 to lysine is on the k(cat) of Glc-T, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of LA; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the Gal-T reaction is reduced 30-fold. The crystal structure of R228K-Gal-T1 complexed with LA, UDP-Gal, and Mn(2+) determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that the Asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. This alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the O4 hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal, probably causing the dissociation of UDP-Gal and the reduced k(cat) of the Gal-T reaction.",

It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these oxysterols on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7KC or 7\u03b2OHC inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, mitochondrial depolarization involving Mcl-1, and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, under treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with Fura-2, no significant Ca(2+) rise was found with the different oxysterols, whereas strong signals were detected with ionomycin used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, 7KC but not 7\u03b2OHC accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, 27OHC was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that \u03b1-tocopherol (but not ellagic acid and resveratrol) was able to counteract 7KC- and 7\u03b2OHC-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of 7KC and 27OHC in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of oxysterols to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GSK-3 and caspase-3 activation is independent of the increase in the Ca(2+) level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.",

In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the \"global affinity\" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.",

Phytotherapy involves the use of herbal formulations, where the mechanisms of action are usually obscure and although studies have confirmed their effectiveness in symptom relief and improving quality of life (QOL), few placebo-controlled trials exist. Both the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin and terazosin) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. Finasteride reduces the static component of BPO--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving LUTS more effectively than finasteride and irrespective of prostate size. All of the various alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of LUTS, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related QOL. However, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects. These documented properties of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonists make them an ideal choice for the medical treatment of symptomatic BPH.",

New data for cattle (Bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding GnRH-II decapeptide possessing arginine (codon: CGG) rather than tryptophan (TGG) at position three in the mature peptide. This substitution is unique. We confirmed the DNA sequence after cloning part of the bovine prepro-GnRH-II gene. Bovine GnRH-II peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. It did not bind to mammalian GnRH receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on types I or II GnRH receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine GnRH-II DNA. A premature stop codon (TGA) replaces the expected tryptophan codon at position seven of GnRH-II in sheep DNA. Thus, both species possess prepro-GnRH-II genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee GnRH-II. The updated bovine type II GnRH receptor gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type II GnRH receptor. Spliced RNA transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. In contrast, bovine prepro-GnRH-I and type I GnRH receptor genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. These findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the human type II GnRH receptor and deletions of prepro-GnRH-II and type II GnRH receptor in laboratory rodents, suggest the GnRH-II system has been replaced by the GnRH-I system or is redundant in certain mammals.",

These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.",

From binding experiments with mutated CB1 and with chimeric CB1/CB2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of CB1 implicated in the recognition of SR 141716A. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm.

To determine whether arginases modulate the endothelial NO synthesis, we investigated the effects of the competitive arginase inhibitor N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (Nor-NOHA) on the activity of NOS, arginases, and L-arginine transporter and on NO release at surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In unstimulated cells, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently reduced the arginase activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microM. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin without extracellular L-arginine, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently increased the NOS activity and the NO release with maximal effects at 20 microM. Extracellular L-arginine also dose-dependently increased NO release and arginase activity. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of 100 microM L-arginine, NOS activity and NO release were similar in untreated and Nor-NOHA-treated cells. However, despite activation of L-arginine uptake, the inhibition of arginase activity by Nor-NOHA was still significant. The depletion of freely exchangeable L-arginine pools with extracellular L-lysine did not prevent Nor-NOHA from increasing the NO release. This indicates the presence of pools, which are accessible to NOS and arginase, but not exchangeable. Interestingly, the mitochondrial arginase II was constitutively expressed, whereas the cytosolic arginase I was barely detectable in HUVECs. These data suggest that endothelial NO synthesis depends on the activity of arginase II in mitochondria and l-arginine carriers in cell membrane.",

The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by N-BPs in hematopoietic tumor cells is mediated by mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways, which are activated by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) biosynthesis. Furthermore, N-BPs decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR via suppression of Ras prenylation and enhanced Bim expression. The present results indicated that N-BPs induce apoptosis by decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increasing the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and enhancing Bim expression through inhibition of the Ras/MEK/ERK and Ras/mTOR pathways. The accumulation of N-BPs in bones suggests that they may act more effectively on tumors that have spread to bones or on Ras-variable tumors.

The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors.

The following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > SL 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > Rec 15/2739 > RS 17053 = SNAP 1069. 4. (-)-Tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities.

In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo \"pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure.

BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells.

Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

Both the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin and terazosin) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. Finasteride reduces the static component of BPO--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving LUTS more effectively than finasteride and irrespective of prostate size. All of the various alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of LUTS, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related QOL. However, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects.

Increased intracellular polyamine levels accompany several types of cancers as well as other human diseases, and compounds that affect the expression, activity, or stability of SSAT are being explored as potential therapeutic drugs. We have expressed human SSAT from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and have determined high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant SSAT, as the free dimer and in binary and ternary complexes with CoA, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), spermine, and the inhibitor N1,N11bis-(ethyl)-norspermine (BE-3-3-3).

Two dimer conformations were observed: a symmetric form with two open surface channels capable of binding substrate or cofactor, and an asymmetric form in which only one of the surface channels appears capable of binding and acetylating polyamines. SSAT was found to self-acetylate lysine-26 in the presence of AcCoA and absence of substrate, a reaction apparently catalzyed by AcCoA bound in the second channel of the asymmetric dimer. These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating SSAT activity or stability as a part of polyamine homeostasis.

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of connexin43 (Cx43) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells. The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells, which is frequently abolished in cancer cells; however, the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood. Disruption of contact inhibition, which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells, reduced Cx43 protein levels, possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation, significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC, in an AhR-dependent manner. Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD, siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells. Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition, which occurs at the post-transcriptional level. This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication, thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC, two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression.",

Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1.

To investigate ways of overcoming 5-FU-resistance, we established acquired-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines against these three drugs by continuous and step-wise escalation of drugs, and analyzed the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of resistance to the drugs. When cells were incubated with the 3 drugs for 72 h, the resistance ratio to parental DLD-1 human colorectal tumor cells was 65.2 for DLD-1/5-FU, 9.7 for DLD-1/FdUrd and 448.6 for DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells. DLD-1/5-FU cells did not show any cross-resistance against FdUrd and F(3)dThd. However, DLD-1/FdUrd cells showed 3- and 9-fold increased resistance to 5-FU and F3(d)Thd, respectively, and DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells also showed about 90-fold resistance to FdUrd. Analysis of enzyme activities and gene expression associated with pyrimidine metabolism indicated that a significant decrease in orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activity in DLD-1/5-FU cells, a 7-fold increase of TS mRNA in DLD-1/FdUrd cells, and a 37-fold decrease in thymidine kinase activity of DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells were the major mechanisms of drug resistance. These findings were closely associated with the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, FdUrd and F3(d)Thd against the established 5-FU-, FdUrd- or F3(d)Thd-resistant cells. When DLD-1/FdUrd cells expressing increased TS mRNA were treated with FdUrd and F3(d)Thd for only 4 h, the resistance ratios of DLD-1/FdUrd cells to parental DLD-1 cells were markedly different for FdUrd and F3(d)Thd, suggesting that the cytotoxicity with short-time exposure to F3(d)Thd is due to a mechanism other than TS inhibition, although the cytotoxicity of F3(d)Thd in the short-time is low compared to that of long-time exposure. In conclusion, F3(d)Thd, an antimetabolite that inhibits TS activity, may be effective against 5-FU and/or FdUrd-resistance in colorectal cancer cells caused by amplification of TS and/or deletion of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase.",

In this study, using a model of gentamicin C (GMC)-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity, we examined whether ligands for megalin protect LLC-PK1 cells from the GMC-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity. We employed apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) and lactoferrin as ligands for megalin. Then the cells were treated with various concentrations of apoE3, lactoferrin and bovine serum albumin with or without 100 microg/ml of GMC, and the SGLT1-dependent methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside (AMG) uptake and levels of SGLT1 expression were determined. As a result, we demonstrated that the apoE3 significantly protects these cells from GMC-induced reduction in AMG uptake, but neither lactoferrin nor albumin does. In accord with a rise in AMG uptake activity, the mRNA and protein levels of SGLT1 were apparently up-regulated in the presence of apoE3. Furthermore, we found that the uptake of [3H] gentamicin is decreased by apoE3, and that apoE3 showed obvious protection against the GMC-dependent N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG) release from LLC-PK1 cells.

Overexpression of PPARdelta by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3epsilon proteins from elimination by sulindac or indomethacin.

In Helicobacter pylori, this enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. In this study, the role of FRD in the colonization of H. pylori was investigated using a mouse model. The frdA gene coding for subunit A of FRD, and two control genes, copA and copP associated with the export of copper out of H. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. The isogenic mutants of H. pylori strain AH244 were obtained by natural transformation. Seventy-five ICR mice (15 mice/group) were orogastrically dosed with either the wild type H. pylori strain AH244, its isogenic mutants, or Brucella broth (negative control). Five mice from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (WPI), respectively. H. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric mucosa infected with the frdA mutant at any time point in the study by both quantitative culture and PCR. In contrast, the mice inoculated with either wild type AH244, copA or copPH. pylori mutants became readily infected. These data indicate that FRD plays a crucial role in H. pylori survival in the gastric mucosa of mice. Given that FRD, present in all H. pylori strains, is immunogenic in H. pylori -infected patients and H. pylori growth in vitro can be inhibited by three anthelmintics (morantel, oxantel and thiabendazole), this enzyme could potentially be used both as a novel drug target as well as in the development of vaccines for H. pylori prevention and eradication.",

In addition, 5HHMF blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB, resulting in suppression of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) subunits, namely p65 and p50, which are important molecules involved in the regulation of iNOS expression. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. Thus, we found that 5HHMF enhances heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. In addition, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a specific HO-1 inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of 5HHMF on LPS-induced NO production. Further, 5HHMF increased specific DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, and transient knockdown with Nrf2 siRNA subsequently reversed 5HHMF-induced NO inhibition, which was followed by suppression of HO-1 activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that 5HHMF suppresses NO production through modulation of iNOS, consequently suppressing NF-\u03baB activity and induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activity.",

Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake. It has been claimed that hCTR1, the human high affinity copper transporter, is the major entry pathway for cDDP and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper. This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to cDDP. We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP. We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher Pt-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum-drugs and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated. Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of hCTR1. If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, hCTR1 is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in copper homeostasis may play a role.",

Decreased expression of VKORC1 resulting from the -1639G>A substitution has also been implicated in lower warfarin dose requirements. We investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in warfarin dose. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with stable anticoagulation were genotyped for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 with Tag-It allele-specific primer extension technology. Plasma S-warfarin concentrations and warfarin maintenance dose were compared among patients on the basis of the VKORC1 -1639G>A genotype. RESULTS: Eighty percent of CYP2C9*1/*1 patients stabilized on <4.0 mg/day warfarin had at least 1 VKORC1 -1639A allele. Mean warfarin doses (SD) were 6.7 (3.3), 4.3 (2.2), and 2.7 (1.2) mg/day for patients with the VKORC1 -1639GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of S-warfarin were lowest in patients with the VKORC1 -1639AA genotype and demonstrated a positive association with the VKORC1 -1639G allele copy number (trend P = 0.012). A model including VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight accounted for 61% of the variance in warfarin daily maintenance dose. CONCLUSIONS: The VKORC1 -1639A allele accounts for low dosage requirements of most patients without a CYP2C9 variant. Higher plasma S-warfarin concentrations corresponding to increased warfarin maintenance dosages support a hypothesis for increased expression of the VKORC1 -1639G allele.

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1.

Treatment with ClpP resulted in hypodiploid DNA contents, increased Bax/ Bcl-2 ratio and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

Moreover, caspase independent apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus in response to ClpP.

Such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant dopamine and serotonin receptors. It has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the dopamine D2 receptor varies between laboratories. Although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. The present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. In general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. Hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or \"zero\" ligand solubility. The extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. These values are here given for dopamine D2 and D4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. These values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. For example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the dopamine D4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3H]-clozapine at D4. However, because clozapine competes with endogenous dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy dopamine D4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nM, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nM in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. The atypical neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nM). Such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous dopamine in the caudate or putamen. Most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nM at dopamine D2 receptors, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. Finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the D2:D4 ratio of the radioligand-independent K values for these two receptors. Thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and those that are selective for dopamine D4 receptors.",

In this study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with TCPP or TDCPP (maximum dose = 51600 and 45000 ng/g egg, respectively) to determine dose-dependent effects on pipping success, development, hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway, and TH levels following 20-22 days of incubation. Neither compound reduced pipping success; however, TCPP significantly delayed pipping at 9240 and 51600 ng/g and reduced tarsus length at 51600 ng/g. TDCPP exposure resulted in significant decreases in head plus bill length, embryo mass and gallbladder size at 45000 ng/g and reduced plasma free T4 levels at 7640 ng/g. Type I deiodinase, liver fatty-acid binding protein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A37 mRNA levels were significantly induced by TCPP, while TDCPP induced CYP3A37 and CYP2H1. Chemical analysis of egg contents at incubation days 0, 5, 11, 18, and 19 revealed that >92% of the injected TCPP or TDCPP concentration was detectable up to day 5; however, <1% was detected by day 19. The observed phenotypic responses to TCPP and TDCPP exposure may be associated with disruption of the TH-axis, which is critical for normal growth and development in birds. The effects of TDCPP on the gallbladder indicate that the disturbance of lipid metabolism is a likely target in its mechanism of toxicity.",

Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of TCDD-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to TCDD, and the endpoints of decreased ATP production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the AHR. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme catalase blocked the TCDD-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, TCDD-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.",

To investigate the possibility that felbamate's favorable toxicity profile could be related to NMDA receptor subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of felbamate block of recombinant NMDA receptors composed of the NR1a subunit and various NR2 subunits. Felbamate produced a rapid, concentration-dependent block of currents evoked by 50 microM NMDA and 10 microM glycine in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the rat NR1a subunit, and either the NR2A, NR2B or NR2C subunits; the IC50 values for block were 2.6, 0.52 and 2.4 mM, respectively (holding potential, - 60 mV). The Hill coefficient values were < 1 and, in kinetic analyses, onset and recovery from block were well fit by double exponential functions, indicating binding to more than one blocking site on the NMDA receptor channel complex. The higher affinity of felbamate block of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit could be accounted for by more rapid association and slower dissociation from these sites. We conclude that felbamate exhibits modest selectivity for NMDA receptors composed of NR1a/NR2B subunits.

We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E(2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood.

Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that ache transcripts and AChE activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to paraoxon (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon concentrations (\u2264250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal AChE expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that may be independent of AChE inhibition.

Such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant dopamine and serotonin receptors. It has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the dopamine D2 receptor varies between laboratories. Although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. The present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. In general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. Hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or \"zero\" ligand solubility. The extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. These values are here given for dopamine D2 and D4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. These values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. For example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the dopamine D4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3H]-clozapine at D4. However, because clozapine competes with endogenous dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy dopamine D4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nM, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nM in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. The atypical neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nM). Such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous dopamine in the caudate or putamen. Most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nM at dopamine D2 receptors, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. Finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the D2:D4 ratio of the radioligand-independent K values for these two receptors. Thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and those that are selective for dopamine D4 receptors.",

However, its selectivity for the various K(ATP) channels is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide. Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that mitiglinide inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM). Nateglinide inhibits Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM, and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations (1 microM). Binding experiments on mitiglinide, nateglinide, and repaglinide to SUR1 expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of [3H]glibenclamide to SUR1 (IC50 values: mitiglinide, 280 nM; nateglinide, 8 microM; repaglinide, 1.6 microM), suggesting that they all share a glibenclamide binding site. The insulin responses to glucose, mitiglinide, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide, nateglinide, or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment. These results indicate that, similar to the sulfonylureas, mitiglinide is highly specific to the Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, i.e., the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, and suggest that mitiglinide may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug.",

We found that in vitro rapamycin also regulates the proteasome, an essential intracellular protease of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Rapamycin inhibits proteinase and selected peptidase activities of the catalytic core proteasome at low micromolar concentrations. Moreover, the drug interferes with binding of the 19S cap essential for processing of polyubiquitinylated substrates, and the PA200 activator to the 20S catalytic core proteasome. These protein complexes are known to bind to specific grooves on the \u03b1 face region of the 20S core. A treatment with rapamycin affects conformational dynamics of the proteasomal gate, a centrally positioned within the \u03b1 face and allosterically regulated element responsible for the intake of substrates. Interestingly, we showed that rapamycin shares all the proteasome targeting properties not only with other two-domain, closed-ring analogs (rapalogs), but also with its single domain mimics, and with seco-rapamycin. The latter is the first in vivo open-ring metabolite of rapamycin that does not affect mTOR.

The nephrotoxic potential of selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur.

In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity.

In Expt. 1, macrophages were collected from broiler chicks fed 3 or 6% dietary fat (g/100 g) with 0, 25, and 50 mg lutein/kg feed for 23 d. In Expt. 2, using a 3 x 3 factorial, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at 0, 15 and 50 micromol/L and lutein at 0, 10 and 100 micromol/L were applied to HD11 cell culture for 24 h. In both experiments, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide before RNA isolation. Lutein interacted with fat in Expt. 1 and with EPA in Expt. 2 to affect mRNA levels of iNOS, PPARgamma, and RXRalpha in chicken macrophages and HD11 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). At 3% dietary fat or up to 15 micromol/L EPA in the medium, increasing lutein increased the iNOS mRNA. However, at 6% dietary fat or 50 micromol/L EPA, lutein did not cause a rise in iNOS mRNA. Increasing lutein in the medium from 0 to 100 micromol/L decreased iNOS mRNA. Increasing lutein with high fat (6%) or EPA (15 micromol/L EPA) increased PPARgamma and RXRalpha mRNA levels. Lutein increased PPARalpha mRNA levels in both macrophages (P < 0.01) and HD11 (P = 0.01) cells and RXRgamma (P < 0.01) mRNA levels in macrophages. GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) the lutein-induced iNOS mRNA downregulation in HD11 cells. LG101208, a RXR antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) iNOS upregulation induced by 10 micromol/L lutein and iNOS mRNA downregulation induced by 100 micromol/L lutein. We conclude that lutein and EPA interact through the PPARgamma and RXR pathways to modulate iNOS mRNA.",

FGFs signal through transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, but heparan sulfate is also required for signaling by members of the FGF family. In addition, heparan sulfate may be involved in determining tissue distribution of FGFs. Using biotinylated FGF-2 and FGF-7 (KGF) as probes, we have identified specific interactions between FGFs and heparan sulfates in human tissues. Both FGF species bind to tissue mast cells and to epithelial cell membranes. Binding to basement membrane heparan sulfate is tissue source dependent and specific. Although FGF-2 strongly binds to basement membrane heparan sulfate in skin and most other tissue sites examined, FGF-7 fails to bind to basement membrane heparan sulfate in most locations. However, in subendothelial matrix in blood vessels and in the basement membrane of a papillary renal cell carcinoma, strong FGF-7 binding is seen. In summary, distinct and specific affinities of heparan sulfates for different FGFs were identified that may affect growth factor activation and local distribution. Heparan sulfate may have a gatekeeper function to either restrict or permit diffusion of heparin-binding growth factors across the basement membrane.",

Conversely, the ratio of fatty acid to glycerol released into the medium decreased. Regulation of cAspAT gene expression was specific to differentiated adipocytes and did not require any peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)/retinoid X receptor-alpha direct binding. Nevertheless, PPARgamma is indirectly necessary for both cAspAT basal expression and TZD responsiveness because they are, respectively, diminished and abolished by ectopic overexpression of a dominant negative PPARgamma. The cAspAT TZD-responsive site was restricted to a single AGGACA hexanucleotide located at -381 to -376 bp whose mutation impaired the specific RORalpha binding. RORalpha ectopic expression activated the cAspAT gene transcription in absence of rosiglitazone, and its protein amount in nuclear extracts is 1.8-fold increased by rosiglitazone treatment of adipocytes. Finally, the amounts of RORalpha and cAspAT mRNAs were similarly increased by TZD treatment of human adipose tissue explants, confirming coordinated regulation. Our data identify cAspAT as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by TZD via the control of RORalpha expression by PPARgamma in adipocytes.",

Given that M-CSF signalling through c-FMS plays an important role in osteoclast biology, we speculated that blocking such a pathway with imatinib may modulate osteoclast activity. Using a cell model of mature rabbit osteoclasts, we thus investigated the effect of imatinib on in vitro osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorbing activity. Our findings demonstrate that imatinib dose-dependently stimulates osteoclast apoptosis, a phenomenon which is blocked by the caspase I inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. The ability of imatinib to enhance osteoclast cell death was accompanied by a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclast bone resorbing activity. Imatinib was also found to inhibit M-CSF-induced osteoclast survival as well as M-CSF-induced osteoclast bone resorbing activity, but was without effect on interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced inhibition of osteoclasts apoptosis, further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib may affect mature osteoclasts through the inhibition of c-FMS. Taken together, these results suggest that imatinib could be of clinical value in treating diseases where bone destruction can occur due to excessive M-CSF production such as osteoporosis, inflammatory-and tumor-induced osteolysis.",

These data have been found true in any thyroid system studied so far, both in terms of immunologic and enzymatic activity of TPO. TSH and cAMP also increase the levels of the specific mRNA for TPO in thyroid cells from different species. Whether this phenomenon is due to a direct transcriptional regulation of the TPO gene, as shown in dog thyroid cells, or to posttranscriptional effects, as it would appear in FRTL-5 cells, remains to be clarified by future experiments. Thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) of Graves' disease also stimulates the expression of M/TPO-Ag. This finding gives further support to the relevance of TSAb in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism and explains the well known observation that the \"microsomal\" antigen is particularly abundant in glands of Graves' patients. The modulation of M/TPO-Ag surface expression by TSH can explain the decrease of circulating anti-MAb observed during L-thyroxine therapy in hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other agents, such as methimazole and sodium iodide, which influence thyroid cell function, do not directly interfere with the expression of M/TPO-Ag. Cytokines, such as gamma-interferon, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 have been shown to inhibit the TSH-induced increase of TPO mRNA, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact role of cytokines in the regulation of M/TPO-Ag expression.",

This effect has been attributed to the antagonist effects of pindolol at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. In the present study, we compared the pharmacology of (+/-)pindolol, WAY-100635 (a 5-HT(1A) antagonist), GR127935 (a 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist), and isamoltane (a 5-HT(1B) antagonist), when given acutely in combination with fluoxetine, using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat.

Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the LPS induced TNF release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced TNF release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner.

Blood, urine, and feces were collected over an extended period of 14 days, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to quantify low levels of radioactivity in plasma at later time points to supplement the less-sensitive liquid scintillation counting technique. An excellent mass balance recovery was achieved representing a mean total of 98.2% of the dose, including 90.5% recovered in the urine. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that radioactivity was moderately associated with the blood cellular components, and together with GSK2251052, both were highly distributed into tissues. The parent compound had a much shorter half-life than total radioactivity in plasma, approximately 11.6 hours compared with 96 hours. GSK2251052 and its major metabolite M3, which resulted from oxidation of the propanol side chain to the corresponding carboxylic acid, comprised the majority of the plasma radioactivity, 37 and 53% of the area under the plasma versus time concentration curve from time zero to infinity, respectively. Additionally, M3 was eliminated renally, and was demonstrated to be responsible for the long plasma radioactivity elimination half-life. A combination of in vitro metabolism experiments and a pharmacokinetic study in monkeys with the inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole provided strong evidence that alcohol dehydrogenase, potentially in association with aldehyde dehydrogenase, is the primary enzyme involved in the formation of the M3 metabolite.",

Neither equine nor human recombinant IL-5 influenced the mRNA expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, or VEGF. These findings suggest that Th2-type cytokines may contribute to pulmonary neutrophilia during allergic inflammation by the increased expression of neutrophil chemokines and adhesion molecules by endothelial cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of alpha1ARs, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors. RESULTS: Further characterization of the alpha1AR gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and alpha1aARs are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high alpha1aAR selectivity have attracted attention. Tamsulosin, which has high affinity for alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes but not for alpha1bAR, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents terazosin and doxazosin. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent alfuzosin also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the alpha1aAR subtype are under investigation.

Compared with the untreated colitis group, the curcumin-treated group showed significant decreases in the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histological score, myeloperoxidase activity, and expressions of NF-\u03baB mRNA, IL-27 mRNA, TLR4 protein, NF-\u03baB p65 protein, and IL-27 p28 protein (p < 0.05). TLR4 mRNA expression did not differ between groups. Disease activity index decreased more rapidly in the curcumin-treated group than in the sulfasalazine-treated group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in TLR4, NF-\u03baB, and IL-27 mRNA and proteins between curcumin-treated and sulfasalazine-treated groups. Curcumin shows significant therapeutic effects on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis that are comparable to sulfasalazine. The anti-inflammatory actions of curcumin on colitis may involve inhibition of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and of IL-27 expression.",

AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.",

Sibutramine showed enantioselective plasma profiles with consistently higher concentrations of R-enantiomers. Clopidogrel and clarithromycin significantly increased the sibutramine plasma concentration, but their effects differed between enantiomers; a 2.2-fold versus 4.1-fold increase in the AUC in S-enantiomer and 1.8-fold versus 2.0-fold for the R-enantiomer, respectively. The AUCs of S- and R-desmethyl metabolites changed significantly during the clopidogrel phase (P\u2009<\u2009.001 and P\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively) but not during the clarithromycin phase (P\u2009=\u2009.099 and P\u2009=\u2009.090, respectively). Exposure to sibutramine was higher in subjects with the CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype, but no statistical difference was observed among the CYP2B6 genotypes. These results suggest that the enantioselective disposition of sibutramine and its active metabolites are influenced by the altered genetic and environmental factors of CYP2B6 and CYP3A activity in vivo.",

This reaction is called aging. The effect of the four mono- and bisquaternary ammonium compounds tetramethylammonium (TMA), hexamethonium, decamethonium and suxamethonium on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited, solubilized AChE from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. All compounds were reversible inhibitors of AChE; the respective dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. The affinities to both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for suxamethonium (Kii 81.3 microM; Ki 15.9 microM) and decamethonium (Kii 15.4 microM; Ki 4.4 microM) than for TMA (Kii 1 mM; Ki 289.6 microM) and hexamethonium (Kii 4.5 mM; Ki 331.8 microM). The reactivation experiments were performed in a four-step procedure (soman-inhibition at 0 degree and pH 10, aging at 37 degrees and pH 7.3, reactivation by the oxime HI 6 at 37 degrees and pH 7.3 followed by AChE assay). After these four steps (total duration 55 min), AChE was inhibited by soman to 95-100%. HI 6 could reactivate about 20% of the inhibited enzyme. All effectors increased the AChE reactivatability by HI 6 when added before aging was started. The maximal increase in reactivatability was higher in the presence of 1.6 mM suxamethonium (+35.8%) and 150 microM decamethonium (+40%) than of 22 mM TMA (+22.5%) and 8.3 mM hexamethonium (+19.2%). If the effectors were added after 5 min of aging they increased the activity of soman-inhibited AChE, but to a considerably smaller extent than HI 6. A good correlation of the respective Kii values and the effective concentrations of these drugs was observed, indicating that an allosteric binding site of AChE might be involved in the protective effect of these drugs.",

They belong to a larger family of transporters composed of 14 members in mammals based on sequence homologies. MCTs are found in various tissues including the brain where three isoforms, MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4, have been described. Each of these isoforms exhibits a distinct regional and cellular distribution in rodent brain. At the cellular level, MCT1 is expressed by endothelial cells of microvessels, by ependymocytes as well as by astrocytes. MCT4 expression appears to be specific for astrocytes. By contrast, the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter is MCT2. Interestingly, part of MCT2 immunoreactivity is located at postsynaptic sites, suggesting a particular role of monocarboxylates and their transporters in synaptic transmission. In addition to variation in expression during development and upon nutritional modifications, new data indicate that MCT expression is regulated at the translational level by neurotransmitters. Understanding how transport of monocarboxylates is regulated could be of particular importance not only for neuroenergetics but also for areas such as functional brain imaging, regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis, or for central nervous system disorders such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative diseases.",

IGFBP-rP1 (MAC25/Angiomodulin/prostacyclin-stimulating factor) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. We have previously shown that IGFBP-rP1 is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and by poorly tumorigenic P69SV40T cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and M12 cells. We now show that IGFBP-rP1 increases during senescence of HPEC. IGFBP-rP2 (also known as connective tissue growth factor), a downstream effector of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of IGFBP-rP2 during senescence of HPEC. Moreover, IGFBP-rP2 noticeably increased in response to TGF-beta1 and all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in HPEC and PC-3 cells, and it decreased in response to IGF-I in HPEC. IGFBP-rP3 [nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV)], the protein product of the NOV protooncogene, was not detected in HPEC but was expressed in the tumorigenic DU145 and PC-3 cells. It was also synthesized by the SV40-T antigen-transformed P69 and malignant M12 cells, where it was down-regulated by atRA. These observations suggest biological roles of IGFBP-rPs in the human prostate. IGFBP-rP1 and IGFBP-rP2 are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (TGF-beta1 and atRA). Although the data collected on IGFBP-rP3 in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by atRA.",

Ex vivo [isolated jejunal segment (IJS) of rat], in vitro, and in vivo assays were used in the study. The results indicated that genistin (5-80 \u03bcmol/L) inhibited the contraction of IJS in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the increased-contractility of IJS induced by acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, high Ca(2+), and erythromycin, respectively. The inhibitory effects of genistin were correlated with the stimulation of alpha adrenergic and beta adrenergic receptors since these inhibitory effects were significantly blocked in the presence of phentolamine and propranolol respectively. No further inhibitory effects of genistin were observed in the presence of verapamil or in Ca(2+)-free condition, indicating genistin-induced inhibitory effects are Ca(2+)-dependent. Genistin decreased myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) protein contents and MLCK mRNA expression in IJS, and inhibited both phosphorylation and Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of purified myosin, implicating that the decrease of MLCK contents and inhibition of MLCK activity are involved in the genistin-induced inhibitory effects.

Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate insulin signaling through the protein kinase B (AKt) pathway and up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 \u03bcM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation. A clear relationship between PTP1B phosphorylation levels at Ser 50 and its negative effect on insulin signaling is shown.",

Mammalian ALDH1B1, another mitochondrial enzyme sharing 72% identity with ALDH2, is also capable of metabolizing acetaldehyde but has a tissue distribution and pattern of activity distinct from that of ALDH2. Bioinformatic analyses of several vertebrate genomes were undertaken using known ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of many representative vertebrate species (including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals) indicated the presence of ALDH1B1 in many mammalian species and in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis); no evidence was found for ALDH1B1 in the genomes of birds, reptiles or fish. Predicted vertebrate ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 subunit sequences and structures were highly conserved, including residues previously shown to be involved in catalysis and coenzyme binding for human ALDH2. Studies of ALDH1B1 sequences supported the hypothesis that the ALDH1B1 gene originated in early vertebrates from a retrotransposition of the vertebrate ALDH2 gene. Given the high degree of similarity between ALDH2 and ALDH1B1, it is surprising that individuals with an inactivating mutation in ALDH2 (ALDH2*2) do not exhibit a compensatory increase in ALDH1B1 activity. We hypothesized that the similarity between the two ALDHs would allow for dominant negative heterotetramerization between the inactive ALDH2 mutants and ALDH1B1. Computational-based molecular modeling studies examining predicted protein-protein interactions indicated that heterotetramerization between ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 subunits was highly probable and may partially explain a lack of compensation by ALDH1B1 in ALDH2(\u2217)2 individuals.",

The latter reaction, catalyzed by aspartoacylase (ASPA), produces acetyl groups plus aspartate and has been proposed to occur in both soluble and membranous subfractions of white matter. Our study supports such bimodal occurrence and we now present immunoblot, proteomic, and biochemical evidence that the membrane-bound form of ASPA is intrinsic to purified myelin membranes. This was supported by a novel TLC-based method for the assay of ASPA. That observation, together with previous demonstrations of numerous lipid-synthesizing enzymes in myelin, suggests utilization of acetyl groups liberated by myelin-localized ASPA for lipid synthesis within the myelin sheath.

Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.",
